  <p class="meta">
    Posted by
    
      <a href="https://cloudisland.nz/@freakboy3742">Russell Keith-Magee</a>
    
    on 1 July 2024 
  </p>
  
  <p>In June, BeeWare made a lot of progress, landing lots of new features -
many of which have been the subject of requests and discussions for a
long time.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1781">added support for packaging console apps to
Briefcase</a>. This
involved adding a new <code>.pkg</code> packaging type for macOS, as well as a
number of other improvements to the stub app and MSI packaging on
Windows. In addition to providing a way to package console apps on
macOS, the addition of <code>.pkg</code> format means it is now possible to
distribute apps using centralised device management tooling (such as
Kandji or FleetDM).</li>
<li>We modified Briefcase to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1849">distribute the stub binaries as standalone
artefacts, rather than including them in the app
template</a>. We also
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1855">significantly optimised how Briefcase uses
templates</a>. Between
these two changes, the download size required for a first project on
macOS has been reduced from around 200MB, to less than 4MB.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1864">isolated Briefcase's use of
Cookiecutter</a> so that
all of Briefcase's cached content is contained in Briefcase's own
cache folder.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1856">added support for distribution certificates on
macOS</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2585">modified Toga's APIs to use namedtuple types for Size and Position
references</a>.</li>
<li>We corrected a number of stability issues with Toga's testbed CI, and
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2670">added CI testing for Wayland on
Linux</a>.</li>
<li>We completed a <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2252">major overhaul of typing in Toga's API
surface</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2642">added support for conditional coverage in Toga's
testing</a>. It is now
possible to get a clean coverage report without running the test suite
on every Python version and every platform.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2636">added an official API for customizing the system-installed menu
items</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1930">added an API for detecting the screens available for an app to
use, and for setting the position of windows relative to those
screens</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2649">added support for "simple"
apps</a> - apps that don't
have menu bars.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2651">added support for apps whose lifecycle isn't tied to a single
"Main" window</a>, such as
background apps (apps that don't have any windows) and document-based
apps.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2669">added support for app modal
dialogs</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>Work on Toga's App interface isn't quite finished - we're expecting to
finalise the Document API in the near future. Once that work is
complete, our focus will be the mobile Python binary packaging
ecosystem. The work we've done so far this year has led to CPython 3.13
formally supporting iOS and Android as Tier 3 supported platforms; the
next step is ensuring that the rest of the community can build iOS and
Android packages. This will involve improvements to tools like <code>pip</code>,
<code>cibuildwheel</code>, <code>meson-python</code> and more. We expect that this work will
take most of the rest of the quarter to release; but there should be
some initial signs of progress by the end of the month.</p>
<h2>Want to get involved?</h2>
<p>Want to get involved? Here are some open issues that would be a great
place to get started with contributing to a BeeWare project. They're all
relatively minor changes, but would provide a big improvement to the
lives of BeeWare users:</p>

  <h2><a href="/fa_IR/news/buzz/may-2024-status-update/">May 2024 Status Update</a></h2>
  <p class="meta">
    Posted by

    on 3 June 2024 
  </p>
  
  <p>BeeWare activity in May was dominated by preparing for and attending
PyCon US in Pittsburgh. That event generated a lot of activity in the
BeeWare project - but we've also added some other significant
improvements.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul>
<li>We attended PyCon US. We presented on the <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2024/events/language-summit/">state of mobile support in
CPython to the Language
Summit</a>; we
<a href="https://us.pycon.org/2024/schedule/presentation/41/">presented a
tutorial</a> to over
30 attendees; we ran a booth in Community Row; we <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2024/schedule/presentation/40/">presented a
talk</a> on writing
a data visualisation app with BeeWare tools; and we ran an extremely
successful sprint. At the peak, we had over 30 people sprinting on
BeeWare projects; and we handed out over 20 challenge coins to first
time contributors. Many of the new features in this status update can
be attributed to contributions from sprint participants.</li>
<li>We modified Toga's Window API to allow <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2314">setting the content of the
window when the window is
constructed</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2591">improved
the APIs for replacing children in an existing window
layout</a>.</li>
<li>We modified how validation of TextInput widgets are handled so that
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2596">change handlers aren't invoked until validation has been
performed</a>.</li>
<li>We modified how the DetailedList is created on Android so that <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2595">the
dependency on the native SwipeRefreshLayout widget only exists if your
app actually uses a DetailedList
widget</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2590">improved the error handling around camera permissions on
macOS</a>, and ensured that
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1820">Briefcase will generate the right permissions for macOS
Sonoma</a>.</li>
<li>We diagnosed some issues associated with code signing on macOS <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1808">when
running on iCloud-mirrored
drives</a>, and when
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1831">Git has been configured to preserve Windows
newlines</a>. We also
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1825">improved the error handling when notarisation
fails</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1807">formally documented the plugin extension points that Briefcase
provides</a>. With this
formally documented interface, Pygame-CE and
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1834">PPB</a>, have taken
formal ownership of their Briefcase bootstraps.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1812">formally adopted PEP 621 format for specifying license files in
Briefcase</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1824">loosened the restrictions on bundle
identifiers</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1811">improved handling of applications with special characters in their
formal names</a>.</li>
<li>We developed a draft implementation of a change that will <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1781">allow
Briefcase to package console
applications</a>. We
expect this change will land in the next week or so, and be released
soon after that.</li>
<li>We started work on <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1849">removing binary stubs from the macOS and Windows
app templates</a>. This
was starting to become a significant performance issue for first-time
Briefcase users.</li>
<li>We improved the mechanism for invoking methods in Rubicon ObjC, making
it possible to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/pull/462">invoke methods with repeated argument
names</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>In June, we're expecting to see progress in three main areas.</p>
<p>Firstly, we'll be finalising the work on packaging console applications.
We expect to see a Briefcase release by mid month that will incorporate
this, and all the other improvements that have landed over the last
month.</p>
<p>Secondly, we'll be working on the APIs for the Toga App and Window
classes. We've already done <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2244">a lot of prototyping work in this
area</a>; once this work is
complete, Toga should have support for apps without a menubar in their
main window, support for status bar apps without a main window, vastly
improved abilities to customise standard menu items, and a stable API
for document-based apps.</p>
<p>Thirdly, we'll start looking at the broader CPython binary packaging
ecosystem. The work we've done so far this year has led to CPython 3.13
formally supporting iOS and Android as Tier 3 supported platforms; the
next step is ensuring that the rest of the community can build iOS and
Android packages. This will involve improvements to tools like <code>pip</code>,
<code>cibuildwheel</code>, <code>meson-python</code> and more. We expect that this work will
take much longer than a month to complete, but we hope to be able to
share some progress in June.</p>

  <p class="meta">
    Posted by
    
      <a href="https://cloudisland.nz/@freakboy3742">Russell Keith-Magee</a>
    
    on 1 May 2024 
  </p>
  
  <p>This month has seen BeeWare reach one major milestone, almost reach a
second, as well as landing several smaller improvements.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul>
<li>iOS is <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0011/#tier-3">officially a Tier 3 supported platform for
CPython</a>! All the patches
needed to support iOS have been merged, and a <a href="https://buildbot.python.org/all/#/builders/1380">buildbot has been
deployed</a> to verify
that CPython can run on iOS. As a result, <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0730/">PEP 730 has been moved into
"Final" status</a>.</li>
<li>Android support in CPython is getting very close to completion. The
last three patches (adding a <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/117878">test harness for running the test suite
on Android</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/118063">redirecting stdout and stderr to the Android
log</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/118352">updating
sysconfig to support
Android</a>) are currently
in review; once those have been merged, and a buildbot has been
deployed, Android should also be at Tier 3 status.</li>
<li>We landed a new <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2462">Geolocation service for
Toga</a>, providing access to
GPS data on mobile devices and macOS.</li>
<li>We made some <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2527">modifications to how Toga handles application
icons</a>, removing the need
to duplicate the icon in application data. These changes are in final
review.</li>
<li>We added a new wizard to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1231">add a Briefcase configuration to an existing
Python project</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1751">modified how Briefcase handles splash screens on mobile
devices</a>, and
corrected some issues with icons seen on recent Android releases.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/pull/446">corrected a problem in Rubicon
ObjC</a> caused by a
change to the <code>ctypes</code> module in CPython 3.13. It might be possible to
upstream this fix to CPython itself; but for now, Rubicon ObjC is able
to support Python 3.13.0a6.</li>
<li>We drafted a new tutorial step about <a href="https://github.com/beeware/beeware/pull/327">customising application
appearance</a>. This update
is in review, and should be live in the near future.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>The bulk of May will be taken up by preparing for and attending PyCon
US. We're presenting a
<a href="https://us.pycon.org/2024/schedule/presentation/40/">talk</a> and a
<a href="https://us.pycon.org/2024/schedule/presentation/41/">tutorial</a>; we're
also <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2024/events/language-summit/">presenting at the Language
Summit</a>, we will have
a booth in the community section of the Expo Hall, and we'll be there
for the first 3 days of the sprints. If you're coming to Pittsburgh and
you'd like to attend that tutorial session, <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2024/attend/information/">ticket sales are
open!</a>. We're also hoping
that we'll be able to wrap up the work on Android support in CPython,
and start work on supporting command line applications in Briefcase.</p>

    on 3 April 2024 
  </p>
  
  <p>Q1 2024 has seen some major progress - but as always, there's still
plenty of work to do. As always, this roadmap should be read as a guide
to what we aim to focus on over the coming quarter, rather than a hard
commitment of features that will be made available on a specific
deadline.</p>
<h2>Q1 progress</h2>
<p>The first quarter of 2024 has seen significant progress towards getting
iOS and Android to Tier 3 supported status in CPython. <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0738/">PEP
738</a> has been formally accepted by
the CPython steering committee, and the vast majority of the changes
needed to support <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/114099">iOS</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/116622">Android</a> have
either been merged, or received substantial review from the CPython core
team.</p>
<p>We've also made progress on a number of long standing feature requests
in Toga. We've added an OptionContainer for Android, so tab-based UIs
can be used on all platforms. We've added a MapView widget that works on
all desktop and mobile platforms. We've also added the start of hardware
APIs, including Camera and Geolocation APIs.</p>
<h2>Q2 priorities</h2>
<p>Our Q2 goals are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Get iOS and Android to Tier 3 supported status</strong>. We expect to
finish upstreaming the patches we have for CPython early in the
quarter. However, Tier 3 status also requires CI infrastructure to
verify that the platforms are stable. In Q2, we will commission
buildbots so that CPython's CI is able to verify the ongoing stability
of iOS and Android as a platform.</li>
<li><strong>Extend the BeeWare tutorial</strong>. The BeeWare tutorial provides a good
introduction to using Briefcase and Toga, but there are a number of
common support questions that aren't covered by the tutorial, and some
features that we've added since the tutorial last saw significant
edits. We're going to revisit the tutorial, adding some extra steps to
cover these new features and common issues.</li>
<li><strong>Attend PyCon US 2024</strong> We're presenting a tutorial and a talk; we
will have a booth in the community section; we'll be there for the
full duration of the sprints; and we're also expecting to attend the
language summit. It's going to be a busy 2 weeks - we hope we see you
there!</li>
<li><strong>Start working on packaging for mobile platforms</strong>. PEP 730 and PEP
738 cover the core of CPython itself, but Python is much more than
just the core interpreter and standard library. There's also the
ecosystem of third-party libraries, many of which have binary
components. In this quarter, we're going to start looking at the
changes that are needed to make it easy for the community to start
packaging wheels for iOS and Android.</li>
<li><strong>Modify the App class to support other types of apps</strong>. This includes
adding an API for a "Simple App" that doesn't have a menu bar,
finalising the API for document-based apps, and providing an API for
system tray apps.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Longer term goals</h2>
<p>Completing PEP 730 and 738 is a major milestone - but there's still a
lot of work to be done. It will take a lot of time and community
education before iOS and Android binary packages are widely available.
We intend to do whatever we can to support the community, ranging from
documentation, to tooling support, to submitting patches to upstream
packages.</p>
<p>One of the ways to accelerate this transition will be to make iOS and
Android compelling platforms to support. This means adding more
capabilities to Toga, so that there aren't any capability gaps for a
user writing an app. It also means writing more documentation and
tutorials so that common app development tasks are well explained.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This month marks 2 years since full-time work began on BeeWare; and 10
years since the first commits on the project. We've come a long way in
that time - from a collection of cobbled-together proof of concept
demonstrators to a fully tested GUI platform, with equally tested
deployment tooling, and official support in CPython itself. The future
for Python as a GUI development platform on desktop and mobile has never
looked better, and we're excited to see what the coming years will
bring.</p>

    on 2 April 2024 
  </p>
  
  <p>This month, we have less to report by raw feature count - but the
changes we <em>have</em> made represent extremely significant progress.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul>
<li>Our primary focus this month has been making the changes to CPython
needed to add support for
<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/114099">iOS</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/116622">Android</a>. We've made
major progress towards this goal: all the patches required for iOS
have been merged; a large number of patches have been submitted for
Android, with only a small number still required. This month, we have:<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/115918">Added test exclusions to support running the test suite on
Android</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/115955">Fixed some issues with the process of building an Android
libPython</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/116215">Modified sys.platform identification for Android so it returns
"android" not
"linux"</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/116674">Added an API to get device and OS information on
Android</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/116379">Modified ctypes so it can load libraries on
Android</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/116423">Modified a signals test to make it more reliable on more
platforms</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/116426">Added a build script and instructions for Android
builds</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/116454">Added a custom module loader so that iOS apps can load binary
modules from
Frameworks</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/116758">Modified test_doctest to support platforms that don't support
subprocesses</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/117052">Modified the standard library to support
iOS</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/117057">Added documentation for the iOS
platform</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/117299">Corrected some additional test failures introduced on
Android</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0738/">PEP 738</a>, adding official Android
support to CPython, has been formally approved by the Python Steering
Council.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/python/devguide/pull/1296">updated the CPython Developer Guide to describe the iOS
development process</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1687">improved Briefcase's handling of stdout for some
tools</a>. We're hoping
this will fix - or at least make it easier to diagnose - a mode of
failure we've had reported for the Android emulator on Windows.</li>
<li>We added <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1676">color to Android's log
output</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2415">corrected the handling of key shortcuts on Window and
GTK</a>, adding a lot of key
combinations that weren't previously possible to represent.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2463">restructured the Toga documentation landing
page</a>, making it easier to
find the documentation you're likely to need.</li>
<li>We landed the <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2379">MapView
widget</a>, and have completed
most of the work on a new <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2462">Geolocation
service</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>In April, we're hoping to wrap up the work on iOS and Android patches
for CPython, and add buildbots for those platforms. With the buildbots
in place, iOS and Android will officially be Tier 3 supported CPython
platforms. We also plan to revisit the BeeWare tutorial, adding some
more steps in preparation for a <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2024/schedule/presentation/41/">tutorial presentation at PyCon
US</a> in May. If
you're coming to Pittsburgh and you'd like to attend that tutorial
session, <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2024/attend/information/">ticket sales are
open!</a></p>
<h2>Want to get involved?</h2>
<p>Want to get involved? Here are some open issues that would be a great

    on 29 February 2024 
  </p>
  
  <p>February may be the shortest month, but that doesn't mean we've got any
less progress to report!</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0738/">PEP 738</a>, adding official Android
support to CPython, has been formally submitted to the Python Steering
Council for approval.</li>
<li>We've started landing patches in CPython to add formal support for
<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/114099">iOS</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/71052">Android</a>. There are
more patches in review, and more to come, but so far we've landed
patches that:<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/114876">Fix the compilation of the grp module on
Android</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/114889">Disable tests that can't run on mobile
platforms</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/115120">Refactor the CPython build system to allow for some of the oddities
of iOS as a platform</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/115390">Add build targets for compiling iOS-compatible
frameworks</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/115780">Correct the linking of extension modules on
Android</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/115917">Enable the concurrent.futures tests on platforms that don't support
multiprocessing</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We added macOS ARM64 machines to our CI capabilities for
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2404">Toga</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1652">Briefcase</a>. We've
officially supported ARM64 on macOS for some time, but we've been
unable to test this support as part of our CI and release procedure -
we've had to do ad-hoc testing on the machines we're using to develop
on a day to day basis. As a result of improvements to GitHub's CI
infrastructure, we're now able to perform automated testing. As part
of these changes, we've also added testing for Python 3.13 (which will
be released around October of this year).</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1930">added an API for detecting the displays attached to a computer,
and specifying the location of windows relative to those
displays</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2387">added a pluggable API for image
formats</a>. With this API,
any third party library that has an internal format for images can
implement support so that Toga can convert to and from images in that
format.</li>
<li>We've significantly improved shortcut key handling on GTK and
WinForms, including <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2415">improved coverage of non-alphanumeric
keys</a>, and support for
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2232">numpad keys</a>.</li>
<li>We've <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2379">added a MapView
widget</a>. This widget is in
final review, but should land very soon.</li>
<li>We've improved error handling when the <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1630">Android emulator fails to
start</a>. This should
hopefully make it easier to identify the source of any emulator
failures.</li>
<li>We've added the ability to run <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1603">Linux apps that have been built for
different platforms</a>.
Using Docker, it's now possible to run a Fedora system app on an
Ubuntu machine, or any other combination of supported platforms.</li>
<li>We've added the ability to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1661">pass extra arguments to Docker when
building images</a>.</li>
<li>We've <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1649">improved the console output for non-interactive
consoles</a> on some
long-running commands.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>In March, we will continue to focus on iOS and Android patches for
CPython; if all goes extremely well, the bulk of patches should be
upstream (or at least submitted for review) by the end of the month.
While we're waiting for CPython patches to be reviewed, we'll be adding
geolocation APIs to Toga.</p>

    on 1 February 2024 
  </p>
  
  <p>January has seen some long awaited and high profile features added to
BeeWare.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0738/">PEP 738</a>, formalizing the
introduction of Android as a Tier 3 platform in CPython, has been
formally accepted as a draft. We're now revising the draft following
community feedback, in anticipation of submitting the PEP for formal
approval in the near future.</li>
<li>We added a cross-platform Camera API to Toga. This API has been
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2266">implemented for iOS and
macOS</a>; the <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2353">implementation
for Android</a> is in final
review.</li>
<li>We added an <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2350">OptionContainer widget for
Android</a>. This now means
that OptionContainer is available on every desktop and mobile
platform.</li>
<li>We added the ability to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2310">define a button with an
Icon</a>. In addition, we've
added some <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2348">major clarifications to the documentation about the
difference between an Icon and an
Image</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2320">reworked the way that widget IDs are
handled</a>. This change was
required due to a bug caused by the interaction of Python's garbage
collector and the widget registry that prevented the re-use of widget
IDs in some situations. The new implementation means that the widget
registry behaves a lot more like a browser's DOM - a widget can only
be discovered by ID when it is actually part of a widget layout.</li>
<li>We added Briefcase support for <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1596">Python 3.12 on
Android</a>.</li>
<li>We added a mechanism for <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1599">defining app
permissions</a> in your
Briefcase project.</li>
<li>We added the ability for Android projects to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1610">declare the native
Android libraries that they depend
on</a>.</li>
<li>We've been polishing the CPython patches necessary to support iOS and
Android, in anticipation of submitting these patches upstream. To
follow progress on this work, subscribe to the CPython tickets for
<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/114099">iOS support</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/71052">Android support</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>In February, we'll be focusing on the iOS and Android patches to
CPython, and the finalisation of <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0738/">PEP
738</a>. While we're waiting for CPython
patches to be reviewed, we'll be looking into geolocation and mapping
functionality.</p>

  <p>It's the start of a new year, which means it's time to cast our minds
forward to what BeeWare will bring in the coming year. 2023 saw some
major milestones in stability and features; in 2024, we're going to
build on that foundation. As always, this roadmap should be read as a
guide to what we aim to focus on over the coming quarter, rather than a
hard commitment of features that will be made available on a specific
deadline.</p>
<h2>Q4 progress</h2>
<p>During the last quarter of 2023, we finally finished our audit and
testing of Toga. We now have 100% branch coverage on every line of
Toga's core, and on the macOS, Windows, GTK, Android and iOS backends.
We published <a href="https://pypi.org/project/toga/0.4.0/">Toga 0.4</a>,
incorporating all these changes - but it also meant that we were able to
start adding <em>new</em> features to Toga, including an OptionContainer widget
on iOS, and a draft of a Camera API for iOS and macOS. Toga's new test
framework has made adding these new features must easier - for example,
we were able to very rapidly identify (and resolve) gaps in
functionality in the new iOS OptionContainer widget by running the
existing test suite on a new implementation. We expect that this testing
foundation will continue to serve us well as we add more features in the
coming year.</p>
<p>The other major development for the quarter was the start of the
upstreaming process for Python on mobile platforms.
<a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0730/">PEP730</a>, proposing the addition of
iOS to the Tier 3 supported list of CPython core, has been ratified by
the steering council; and
<a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-738-adding-android-as-a-supported-platform/40975">PEP738</a>,
proposing the same for Android, is in draft form. The first patch
contributing towards iOS support has already landed.</p>
<h2>Q1 priorities</h2>
<p>Our Q1 goals are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Complete upstreaming iOS and Android support patches to CPython
core</strong>. We will finalise PEP738 and submit it for ratification; and
we'll continue upstreaming the iOS and Android patches that we've been
maintaining independently. This work has a hard deadline of May 7, as
that is when Python 3.13.0b1 is planned, which is the feature cutoff
for Python 3.13 development, so making sure we hit that deadline will
be our main priority.</li>
<li><strong>Add OptionContainer for Android</strong>. The implementation on iOS was
relatively straightforward; we have no reason to believe that the
Android implementation will be any more complicated.</li>
<li><strong>Complete the implementation of the Camera API</strong>. We have a draft PR
implementing a Camera API on macOS and iOS; we'll extend this API to
Android, and complete the work on Briefcase that is needed to add
support for permissions.</li>
<li><strong>Add an API for geolocation, and a Map widget</strong>. Geolocation is
another major hardware features that is common on phones; we need to
write a cross-platform layer for that hardware, plus add a native
mapping widget to show off this capability.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Longer term goals</h2>
<p>For the remainder of this year, you can expect to see three major themes
in BeeWare development.</p>
<p>Firstly, we're going to continue to work upstreaming the work BeeWare
has done in the mobile space into the wider CPython community. Once iOS
and Android have been incorporated into CPython core, the focus will
move to the packaging ecosystem. This means adding official support to
upload iOS and Android packages to PyPI, and making it easy for third
party projects to incorporate iOS and Android builds into their release
processes.</p>
<p>Secondly, we'll be increasing our efforts in education and training.
BeeWare has a tutorial that we're extremely proud of - but there are
many things we could add to that tutorial, and there are plenty of "How
To" and topic guides that could be written for those who have finished
the tutorial and want to try more advanced ideas.</p>
<p>Thirdly, we'll continue to expand the capabilities of Toga. There are a
handful of high profile widgets and capabilities that have been
patiently waiting for us to have a stable platform to build on, and the
spare capacity to implement them - features like a Radio Button widget,
Trees and Tables on mobile platforms, a cross-platform Settings API, and
cross-platform cloud file access.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>2024 promises to be a very exciting year for BeeWare. For the last 2
years, we've been focused on consolidating and stabilizing existing
features. That work is coming to a close, which will allow us to turn
our attention to building new features that show off the stable
foundation we've built, and to providing the resources that will allow
more users to try BeeWare for themselves.</p>

      <a href="https://cloudisland.nz/@freakboy3742">Russell Keith-Magee</a>
    
    on 31 December 2023 
  </p>
  
  <p>December has been a short month due to end-of-year holidays, but BeeWare
has still made some important progress.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0730/">PEP730</a>, formalizing the
introduction of iOS as a Tier 3 platform in CPython, has been
<a href="https://github.com/python/steering-council/issues/218#issuecomment-1839333665">ratified by the CPython Steering
Council</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/112738">first patch to CPython that explicitly mentions
iOS</a> has been merged.
This is a relatively minor change that is required for building
cross-platform binary modules; we'll start submitting more substantial
patches in the new year.</li>
<li><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0738/">PEP738</a>, formalizing the
introduction of Android as a Tier 3 platform in CPython, has been
drafted, and is <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-738-adding-android-as-a-supported-platform/40975">currently under
discussion</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://chaquo.com/chaquopy/chaquopy-version-15-0-1/">Chaquopy 15 was
released</a>,
adding support for Python 3.12 on Android. This release also improves
compatibility with Android Studio's transition away from Groovy,
towards Kotlin for configuration.</li>
<li>An <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2259">implementation of OptionContainer was added for
iOS</a>.</li>
<li>A number of improvements were made to image handling, including
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2263">optimizations when creating images from internal
APIs</a>, and a <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2276">correction to
flexible image resizing
behavior</a>.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2291">long standing bug that would cause macOS tables to
crash</a> was resolved.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2260">ability to define platform-specific
icons</a> was added to Toga.</li>
<li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/toga/0.4.1/">Toga 0.4.1 was released</a>,
incorporating the features and bug fixes from the last 2 months.</li>
<li>Work has begun on a <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2266">cross-platform Camera
API</a> . This currently works
on iOS, with a draft implementation on macOS. Before this work can
land, we need to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/547">add support in Briefcase for declaring
permissions</a>; a
design for this has been proposed, and will be implemented early in
the new year.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>When we return from the end-of-year break, we'll be back into developing
Toga. In the near future, you should see an OptionContainer on Android,
and permission support in Briefcase; once that work is wrapped, we'll
start looking at more more hardware APIs and missing widgets. You should
also start to see more patches land in CPython to support iOS, and the
finalisation of <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0738/">PEP 738</a>.</p>
<h2>Want to get involved?</h2>
<p>Want to get involved? Here are some open issues that would be a great

  <h2><a href="/fa_IR/news/buzz/november-2023-status-update/">November 2023 Status Update</a></h2>
  <p class="meta">
    Posted by
    
      <a href="https://cloudisland.nz/@freakboy3742">Russell Keith-Magee</a>
    
    on 1 December 2023 
  </p>
  
  <p>November has been a month of focus on the code that enables us to run
Python on iOS and Android - but there has still been some other high
profile developments in other parts of BeeWare.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0730/">PEP730</a>, formalizing the
introduction of iOS as a Tier 3 platform in CPython, has been
<a href="https://github.com/python/steering-council/issues/218">submitted to the Python Steering Council for
ratification</a>.</li>
<li>One of the major topics covered by the <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-730-adding-ios-as-a-supported-platform/35854">discussion about
PEP730</a>
was the use of a deprecated compiler argument. This led to some
re-examination of how CPython could be delivered on iOS without using
that argument. As a result of that discussion, modifications to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/Python-Apple-support/pull/191">use
CPython as a dynamically loaded
framework</a>
have been prepared. Although the original focus of this work was iOS,
the same change will be also used for macOS - which means BeeWare no
longer needs to compile a macOS support package (although we will
still be lightly re-packaging the official CPython installer).</li>
<li>We modified Toga's Image APIs so that <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2231">Pillow images can be used as
source data</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2230">switched CI testing of Android apps to use a Linux
machine</a>. This wasn't
previously possible, because GitHub didn't expose the necessary
permissions in their Linux images; however, now that <em>is</em> possible,
our Android tests run up to 5 times faster, and are less likely to be
held up in CI because of availability of macOS testing machines.</li>
<li>We corrected an issue on macOS where an OS-level setting controlling
the use of tabs could <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2218">cause test failures in the Toga test
suite</a>.</li>
<li>There have been some extended discussions and draft PRs related to
Toga's <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2244">Application base
class</a>, and the addition of
support for <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2238">status icons</a>.
These PRs are still in active development, but they will open up some
interesting possibilities for Toga apps when they are completed.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1550">Briefcase</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2229">Toga</a> and <a href="https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/pull/387">Rubicon
ObjC</a> were all
modified to use PEP621 metadata, removing the need for <code>setup.cfg</code>,
<code>setup.py</code>, and <code>MANIFEST.in</code> files. As part of this change, we wrote
a new <a href="https://github.com/beeware/setuptools_dynamic_dependencies">setuptools
plugin</a> to
allow for dependencies to be dynamically defined.</li>
<li>We modified Briefcase so that <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1552">answers to the new project
wizard</a> and <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1542">values
for configuration settings when running
commands</a> can be
overridden at the command line. This is mostly useful for testing
purposes - it's now possible to generate a project and build it
against a local template or support package build without needing to
modify a <code>pyproject.toml</code> file or override input handling.</li>
<li>We refactored the new project wizard so that <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1524">support for GUI toolkits
is generated by an extensible
plugin</a>. Although we
still ship with support for Toga, PySide, Pygame and PPB, this support
is provided through a public interface, allowing other GUI toolkits to
provide Briefcase with toolkit-specific modifications to the new
project.</li>
<li>We switched the default Android skin used by Briefcase from the <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1554">Pixel
3a device skin to the Pixel 7
skin</a>. This is an
entirely cosmetic change, but it does mean that screenshots will use a
device that looks a little more modern.</li>
<li>We've made significant progress on the <a href="https://github.com/chaquo/chaquopy/milestone/3">modifications to Chaquopy to
support CPython 3.12</a>.
This support will hopefully be released at the same time as the
upcoming Android Studio "Hedgehog" release.</li>
<li>We've made significant progress on running CPython's unit test suite
on iOS in a CI configuration.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>We won't see as much progress as normal in December as a result of the
end-of-year holidays. However, before we sign off for the year, we're
hoping to start looking at OptionContainer on mobile platforms, and
possibly start looking at Camera API support.</p>
