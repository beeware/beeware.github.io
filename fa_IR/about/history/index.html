    <h2>History</h2>
<p>The BeeWare project started with a simple question: Why aren't the tools
that we use as Python developers improving at the same rate as the rest
of the technology we use on a daily basis?</p>
<p>Python has proven itself as a highly capable language - approachable for
newcomers, but powerful in the hands of experts. Python is rapidly
becoming a major part of the data analysis, scientific computing, and
web development landscape. And initiatives like <a href="https://djangogirls.org/">Django
Girls</a> have demonstrated that using Python, it
is possible to provide a 1-day training courses that introducing people
with no programming experience to Python; and at the end of a day,
attendees have developed and deployed a database-backed dynamic website,
deployed to a publicly visible server.</p>
<p>However, the developer experience for someone writing Python sometimes
reflects more of the early 90's than the new millennium. The default
development environment for Python is still an 80x25 console window. For
users who have come from a Windows or Apple environment, where they're
used to highly detailed, well designed graphical interfaces, this 30
year flashback can be a completely alien experience.</p>
<p>And, yes, there are IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) that
provide a native application experience for writing code. But those
tools require you to adopt, wholesale, the IDE's way of looking at a
project. They often introduce as many headaches to the development
process as they solve.</p>
<p>And so, we're left with an interesting schism, between the "old way" of
Unix development in a console window, and the "new way" of all-in-one
IDEs.</p>
<h3>The Unix Philosophy</h3>
<p>However, it doesn't have to be that way. The core tenet of the Unix
Philosophy is that "each tool does one thing, well". This is a very
powerful philosophy, and it enables the composition of extremely
powerful toolchains by putting together a suite of extremely focussed,
independent tools.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most UNIX tools have convolved this to also mean "all
tools must use a console interface". However, there's nothing in the
UNIX philosophy that says that tools have to use a console interface -
it's just turned out that way.</p>
<p>The BeeWare project started with the premise we can have the best of
both worlds. We can have a chain of composable tools that each do one
thing, well. But those tools can also expose their functionality using a
rich graphical user interface.</p>
<h2>More than just code</h2>
<p>It's about more than just code, though. A successful software project
requires documentation, design skills, feedback and bug reports. The
BeeWare community acknowledges that <em>all</em> contributions are important -
not just the ones that come as a pull request on GitHub.</p>
<p>Even then, it's easy to think of a project in a vacuum, as the sum of
all contributions. But that's never the case. An open source project is
about community.</p>
<h3>Diversity and inclusion</h3>
<p>A diverse community is a strong community. This means accepting people
of all levels of experience, from all backgrounds, of all races, creeds,
orientations and expressions. The BeeWare project is committed to
developing and maintaining a inclusive, diverse and welcoming community.</p>
<p>To back this up, we have an open offer to mentor anyone who wants to get
involved as a contributor, and a <a href="/community/behavior/code-of-conduct/">Code of
Conduct</a> that is rigorously
enforced. Any reports of violations of that code of conduct - even by
senior community members - will be treated with respect and actioned
appropriately.</p>
<h3>Healthy and sustainable</h3>
<p>It's also important to make sure that the community is accessible and
sustainable. It's unfortunately become an accepted part of Open Source
culture that "true" Open Source projects have to be developed entirely
by volunteers. This acts as a barrier to entry for many groups - the
only people able to spend their free time volunteering are those that
<em>have</em> free time.</p>
<p>It also frequently leads to burnout and other mental health issues
amongst contributors. The fact that depression, anxiety, and burnout are
so common in software development communities shouldn't be considered a
badge of honour, or a demonstration of how committed a development team
can be. It's a problem that needs to be tackled head on, and addressed
in the same way a software bug would be addressed - with immediate
workarounds, and long term plans to remove the systemic cause of the
problem.</p>
<p>While we place incredible value on the contributions of volunteers, we
also know that volunteer efforts alone aren't the way to develop a
healthy and sustainable community. For that reason, financial
sustainability is a key consideration in the operation of the BeeWare
project. As a community, we don't ignore the role that money has to play
in providing the resources that allows people to begin and continue to
contribute. We will, as a community, provide accepted mechanisms for
individuals to monetize their work in meaningful ways, and wherever
possible, compensate people for their work - without compromising the
ideals of Open Source development.</p>
