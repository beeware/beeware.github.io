  </p>
  
  <p>In Q3, BeeWare saw the release of Python 3.14 with official Android artefacts, more Python packaging improvements, and significant improvements to our documentation infrastructure. As always, this roadmap should be read as a guide to what we aim to focus on over the coming quarter, rather than a hard commitment to features that will be made available on a specific deadline.</p>
<p>This Q4 roadmap has been published a little later than normal so that we can fit in with quarterly planning cadence at Anaconda (who employ two of the BeeWare core team). Going forward, you can expect that BeeWare's quarterly plans will be published a couple of weeks into the quarter.</p>
<h2>Q3 progress</h2>
<p>The end of Q3 sees the release of a new Python version - 3.14. The 3.14 release contains official Android binary artefacts, and a number of improvements to the iOS build process that will lead to official iOS binary artefacts, hopefully in the near future. It also contains restored support for Emscripten as a Tier 3 supported platform. Landing these improvements in 3.14, and ensuring that the BeeWare ecosystem is in a position to use those changes, was a subject of considerable effort in Q3. We were also forced to respond to a number of significant changes to the GitHub Actions macOS ecosystem - work that is ongoing as a side effect of macOS 26 changes and the deprecation of Intel as a supported macOS platform.</p>
<p>We continued to make progress on the state of binary packaging for iOS and Android. cibuildwheel 3.1 included support for Android that we contributed; as a result, it is now possible for projects to have CI pipelines that generate both iOS and Android wheels. We now have a <a href="https://beeware.org/mobile-wheels/">leaderboard of mobile wheel support in Python</a>, and we're starting to see others in the Python community contribute iOS and Android support updates to popular Python projects. We've also been able to consolidate some of the work that we've done on establishing cross-platform environments into a single standalone package - <a href="https://pypi.org/project/xbuild/"><code>xbuild</code></a> - that can be used to replicate the functionality that cibuildwheel relies on for cross-platform builds.</p>
<p>We made many improvements in Briefcase's Windows installer support. This began with migrating to a current version of WiX, which then allowed us to add several new features, including displaying a license agreement, offering installation options, and running custom installer and uninstaller scripts.</p>
<p>BeeWare's documentation has also seen some significant improvements. Building on the improvements to the website, we've been able to begin switching our documentation from using reStructuredText to Markdown. reStructuredText is a markup standard that is historically significant in the Python community, but sees very little use elsewhere. It's clear that the rest of the online world has adopted Markdown, and Markdown is also significantly simpler as a syntax; we're hoping that these two factors should make it easier for new contributors to get involved in BeeWare development, and simplify some documentation tasks for BeeWare maintainers. We've already ported many of our READMEs, our tutorial, and Toga's documentation to Markdown format, with more changes to come.</p>
<p>Our students from Curtin University have almost concluded their capstone projects. As a result, Briefcase now has significantly improved deployment options for web-based projects, and the foundations for some significant improvements to how Briefcase uses virtual environments are in place. Although our students will be signing off shortly, we expect to be able to deliver some substantial improvements to Briefcase using these features in the coming quarter.</p>
<p>Lastly, we had a successful attendance at EuroPython, PyCon AU, and PyCon UK, presenting multiple talks, tutorials, and introducing a large number of people to Open Source contribution through the sprints. We also attended the Python Core Team sprint, providing a great opportunity to finalize some details in the 3.14 release, and discuss our plans for the upcoming 3.15 release.</p>
<h2>Q4 priorities</h2>
<p>In Q4, we're hoping to make one final push on binary packaging for mobile platforms. In addition to wrapping up work on some of the more notable scientific Python packages (such as NumPy and Pandas), we intend to look into packages that are built using Rust. Rust is becoming an increasingly important part of the Python binary ecosystem, and Rust already has support for iOS and Android. However, we need to make sure that Python/Rust tools like Maturin are able to support cross compilation.</p>
<p>We also want to wrap up our work getting iOS binary artefacts as part of the CPython release process, and work on getting those artefacts into use with Briefcase. This will require some improvements to Briefcase, making use of the <code>xbuild</code> package, and the work contributed by our Curtin University students.</p>
<h2>Longer term goals</h2>
<p>Looking to 2026, after 2 years of building a foundation for a stable, officially supported story for Python on mobile, we can turn our attention back to the apps that people build with BeeWare. This will mean filling some functionality gaps in Toga to satisfy some common app requirements, and writing more documentation and tutorials to help people write apps with BeeWare's tools.</p>
<p>We're also expecting that 2026 will see more integration between BeeWare's tools and other packaging tools. We're already exploring ways that Briefcase can integrate better with Conda. <code>uv</code> is another tool that might fit well in the Briefcase development story, and some of the changes landed by our Curtin students make exploring these options much easier.</p>

  </p>
  
  <p>September has been a busy month for conference travel, but we've also managed to make some important improvements to projects in the BeeWare ecosystem.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul>
<li>We attended <a href="https://2025.pycon.org.au">PyCon AU</a>, giving a presentation about the process of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytlbiDF0Ba4">creating Android and iOS wheels</a>.</li>
<li>We attended the CPython core team summit at the ARM campus in Cambridge, UK. This was an opportunity to finalise work on the upcoming 3.14 release, and discuss plans for the 3.15 release cycle. We also gave a short presentation about the state of the cross-compilation ecosystem in Python.</li>
<li>We attended <a href="https://2025.pyconuk.org/">PyCon UK</a>, giving a presentation about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ostpR-Sg_8">writing GUI apps in Python</a>.</li>
<li>We made the first releases of our new cross-platform build management project, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/xbuild"><code>xbuild</code></a>. At this point, <code>xbuild</code> can be used to create cross-platform virtual environments, and to drive compilation of binary wheels on iOS and Android.</li>
<li>We added code to CPython to manage the <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/138176">compilation of an iOS XCframework artefact</a>. This change also involved a significant reorganisation of the iOS code so that other Apple backends (tvOS, watchOS, visionOS, and MacCatalyst) can be added, sharing the same XCframework and testbed tooling. This is also an important step towards adding iOS builds to Python's CI matrix, and towards producing iOS binary artefacts as part of the CPython release process.</li>
<li>We added code to CPython that handles <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/139163">Apple's recently announced requirement for Privacy Manifests</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/138649">updated CPython's Android CI</a> to use the same set of test options as the other platforms.</li>
<li>We contributed changes to CMake <a href="https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/merge_requests/11153">improving the handling of Android Python modules</a>.</li>
<li>We added an <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3729">ActivityIndicator widget for Android</a>. </li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3581">improved the size hinting of DateInput and TimeInput widgets on iOS</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3768">enabled focus handling on Table and Tree widgets on desktop platforms</a>.</li>
<li>We investigated a number of reported issues relating to the macOS and iOS 26 releases, the rollout of the new "Liquid Glass" style, and what BeeWare needs to do in order to comply with this new style.</li>
<li>We continued to make progress on migrating BeeWare's documentation to use Markdown, instead of Restructured Text. A lot of the effort over the last month has related to translation tooling; but we're almost ready to switch the BeeWare tutorial over to the Markdown version. We've also made some progress on migrating Toga's documentation to Markdown. This is a much bigger project as it involves API documentation, and much more complex cross-linking relationships.</li>
<li>We performed some initial investigations into post-install and pre-uninstall scripting on Windows. This work should yield results in the coming month.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>With conference season over for another year, we'll be able to give our full focus to making improvements on BeeWare and related projects. In the next month, we're hoping to wrap up our work on adding post-install and pre scripts to Briefcase's Windows installers. October will also see the release of Python 3.14.0, and there will be some work related to finalizing BeeWare's support of that release. We also hope to start looking at the tooling for building Rust packages for iOS and Android.</p>
<h2>Want to get involved?</h2>
<p>Want to get involved? We curate issues that should be approachable for first-time contributors to BeeWare. They're all relatively minor changes, but would provide a big improvement to the lives of BeeWare users:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you're interested in the tooling for deploying applications to various platforms, take a look at <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22">Briefcase</a></li>
<li>Or, if you're interested in GUI widgets, take a look at <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22">Toga</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These lists can also be filtered by platform - so you can find issues that are specific to your preferred operating system. Pick one of these tickets, drop a comment on the ticket to let others know you're looking at it, and try your hand at a PR! We have a <a href="https://briefcase.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how-to/contribute-code.html">guide on setting up a Briefcase development environment</a>; but if you need any additional assistance or guidance, you can ask on the ticket, or join us on the <a href="https://beeware.org/bee/chat/">BeeWare Discord server</a>.</p>

  </p>
  
  <p>August has been a slow month due to some personal leave, and some unexpected road bumps from GitHub - but BeeWare has still made some notable progress.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3140rc2/">Python 3.14.0rc2 has been released</a> - including, for the first time, official Android binaries! You can now download official, pre-compiled Android binaries for CPython. This is a major milestone for Android support, as it means BeeWare is able to use official binaries when building Android apps. </li>
<li>As part of the changes adding official Android binaries to the release process, <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/137186">Android was added to the CI checks that are performed as part of every CPython pull request on GitHub</a>. This will significantly reduce the likelihood of bugs landing in main that will break the Android buildbots.</li>
<li>We spent a significant amount of time <a href="https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/12777">dealing with an update to  GitHub Actions</a>. On August 11, GitHub rolled out an update to the disk image they use for macOS 15 machines - and in the process, broke the tools that BeeWare uses to test iOS applications. It took almost a week to identify the cause of this problem, and develop a fix. However, the good news is that <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/138018">the fix significantly simplifies the iOS testing process</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/138176">began the process of adding official Python binaries for iOS</a>. The complexity of iOS multi-architecture builds makes official builds a little more complicated than Android, but we're hopeful this work will be able to land in the near future.</li>
<li>We added a recipe for building <a href="https://github.com/beeware/cpython-apple-source-deps/pull/64">iOS binaries for zstandard</a>. These are needed to support the new zstandard compression library in Python 3.14.</li>
<li>We released a <a href="https://beeware.org/mobile-wheels/">website to track the status of binary wheel support for iOS and Android</a>.</li>
<li>We released <a href="http://pypi.org/project/briefcase/0.3.25/">Briefcase 0.3.25</a>. This release was primarily required because of a change to Android Play Store target SDK requirements.</li>
<li>We modified how Briefcase <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2443">determines the minimum supported macOS/iOS version that Python requires</a>. This change allows us to simplify the contents of the support packages.</li>
<li>We made Briefcase <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2429">more resilient to badly packaged binary wheels on macOS</a>. Many packages publish <code>py3-none-any</code> wheels, which <em>should</em> be platform independent - but then include platform-specific binaries or dynamic library content in the wheels. Briefcase will now ignore these files.</li>
<li>Briefcase's unit tests have been made <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2434">more resilient to temporary network outages</a> - something that happens surprisingly often in the GitHub Actions environment.</li>
<li>We dropped support for Python 3.9, and added support for Python 3.14 across BeeWare projects. For the first time, this includes the ability to release Windows support <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2432">based on pre-releases of Python</a> - previously, we had to wait until the <code>.0</code> release of a new Python version before we could add support.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3683">improved the checks (and error reporting) associated with using new versions of Travertino with old versions of Toga</a>.</li>
<li>We resolved a long standing bug on iOS where <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3680">touch events wouldn't be triggered if content was "below the fold" on a scroll container</a>.</li>
<li>We started work on a <a href="https://github.com/beeware/xbuild">new tool to consolidate the cross-platform building tools used on Android, iOS and Emscripten</a>. This tool still needs a lot of work before it's production-ready, but it draws from our lessons learned on cibuildwheel, and should allow us to simplify and consolidate the approaches taken to implement cross-platform builds. </li>
<li>We made significant progress on migrating BeeWare's documentation to use Markdown, instead of Restructured Text. We've got <a href="https://github.com/beeware/beeware-docs-tools">tools and themes in place</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/beeware/beeware-tutorial/pull/3">tutorial is almost ready to switch to new Markdown-based content</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>September will involve a lot of travel - we'll be attending <a href="https://2025.pycon.org.au">PyCon AU</a>, the CPython core team summit, and <a href="https://2025.pyconuk.org/">PyCon UK</a>. We'll be speaking at <a href="https://2025.pycon.org.au/program/SQUT77/">PyCon AU</a> and <a href="https://pretalx.com/pyconuk-2025/talk/PUBM3T/">PyCon UK</a>, and running a <a href="https://2025.pyconuk.org/sprints/">sprint at PyCon UK</a> as well. Tickets are still on sale for both events - we hope to see you there!</p>
<p>When we're not travelling, we're going to continue working on getting iOS binary artefacts into Python's CI and release processes, and on improving the tools for packaging binary wheels for mobile platforms.</p>
<p>Lastly, we're planning to look at adding post-install scripts to Briefcase installers. We'll be focussing on Windows installers initially; but the intention is that any changes we implement could also be implemented on macOS or Linux.</p>

  </p>
  
  <p>In July, BeeWare hit some more major milestones in our work on mobile packaging - but we also found time to make some improvements to other parts of BeeWare.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul>
<li>We attended <a href="https://ep2025.europython.eu">EuroPython</a>, where we gave a tutorial and a talk, attended the WebAssembly summit, and ran a sprint - at which we gave out 25 BeeWare challenge coins to first-time contributors.</li>
<li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/cibuildwheel/3.1.0/">cibuildwheel 3.1</a> has been released - which includes support for building Android wheels! As a result, we've been able to submit a pull request for <a href="https://github.com/amitdev/lru-dict/pull/74">lru-dict</a>; we're expecting to submit Android support PRs for other projects in the coming months.</li>
<li>We started the process of <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/137186">adding Android builds to CPython's CI</a>. This also means we're in a position to <a href="https://github.com/python/release-tools/pull/265">generate Android release artefacts as part of the release process</a> - possibly as soon as Python 3.14.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://buildbot.python.org/#/builders/1810">Emscripten buildbot is now passing all tests</a>! This formally <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0011/#tier-3">restores Emscripten to the Tier-3 support level</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/pillow/11.3.0/#files">Pillow 11.3.0</a> has been released, including official iOS wheels.</li>
<li>We submited a pull request to add <a href="https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/28759">iOS support for NumPy</a>. This PR is waiting on a release of <code>meson-python</code> before it can be submitted for review, but it is passing the NumPy test suite.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2355">Briefcase has been updated to use WiX 5.0</a>. This enabled us to resolve a number of issues related to MSI support, including resolving an issue with <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2390">long file names in packaged content</a>.</li>
<li>We added support for <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2369">port forwarding when running Android apps</a>. This will be used as part of adding debugger support to Briefcase.</li>
<li>We added a new <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2360">topic guide on publishing apps to the macOS App Store</a>.</li>
<li>We improved a number of error messages generated by Briefcase, providing more guidance on <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2410">how to run an iOS app on a device</a>, <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2400">problems that can be caused by virus scanners</a>, and how to resolve <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2397">inconsistent file content in macOS wheels</a>.</li>
<li>We reviewed our contribution guides for <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2363">Briefcase</a> and <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3597">Toga</a> to remove inconsistencies in the contribution experience.</li>
<li>We added a <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3647">DateInput widget to Toga's GTK backend</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3638">completed a review of Toga's example code to ensure that they all run without warnings, and use the current preferred syntax for describing styles</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3648">corrected the naming of the wheel for Toga's Winforms backend</a> to reflect that it contains a platform-specific binary.</li>
<li>We added <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3631">a shorthand property for defining all the features of a widget's font in one declaration</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3665">simplified Toga's color representations to be better aligned with CSS color interpretations</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3569">refactored Toga's font handling</a> so that font loading logic (and, in particular, error handling) is consistent across platforms.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>With cibuildwheel now supporting both iOS and Android, our work on binary packaging can now shift fully to the upstream projects that will use cibuildwheel to produce wheels. Over the coming months, we expect to submit PRs to more upstream projects; we're also planning to look at packaging that <em>doesn't</em> use cibuildwheel (such as Rust-based packages that use Maturin for packaging). We're also going to start documenting what we've learned about binary packaging for iOS and Android, so that the wider community can start contributing iOS and Android recipes.</p>
<p>We're also going to continue the process of integrating the production of iOS and Android binary artefacts into Python's CI and release processes. We've already begun this process for Android; iOS requires a little more preparatory work, which will be a major area of focus in August.</p>
<p>Lastly, we're planning to look at adding post-install scripts to Briefcase installers. We'll be focussing on Windows installers initially; but the intention is that any changes we implement could also be implemented on macOS or Linux.</p>
<h2>Want to get involved?</h2>
<p>Want to get involved? We curate issues that should be approachable for first-time contributors to BeeWare. They're all relatively minor changes, but would provide a big improvement to the lives of BeeWare users:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you're interested in the tooling for deploying applications to various platforms, take a look at <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22">Briefcase</a></li>
<li>Or, if you're interested in GUI widgets, take a look at <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22">Toga</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These lists can also be filtered by platform - so you can find issues that are specific to your preferred operating system. Pick one of these tickets, drop a comment on the ticket to let others know you're looking at it, and try your hand at a PR! We have a <a href="https://briefcase.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how-to/contribute-code.html">guide on setting up a Briefcase development environment</a>; but if you need any additional assistance or guidance, you can ask on the ticket, or join us on the <a href="https://beeware.org/bee/chat/">BeeWare Discord server</a>.</p>

  </p>
  
  <p>In Q2, BeeWare reached some public milestones in our iOS binary packaging, and saw some unexpected improvements in our documentation and website. As always, this roadmap should be read as a guide to what we aim to focus on over the coming quarter, rather than a hard commitment of features that will be made available on a specific deadline.</p>
<h2>Q2 progress</h2>
<p>In Q2, we continued to make progress on the state of binary packaging for iOS and Android. cibuildwheel 3.0 has now been released, incorporating the iOS support that we contributed; as a result, we've been able to start the process of submitting patches to Python projects to add iOS support. We're still waiting on a formal release of meson and meson-python that includes the iOS changes that we provided; once those releases occur, we'll be able to submit patches for even more projects. We also continued to work on supporting Android in cibuildwheel. This work is still in the review phase; we're hoping it will be concluded in the near future.</p>
<p>A CPython buildbot for Emscripten is now live. The process of launching this buildbot revealed a number of bugs that required resolution; a small number of bugs still remain. We don't anticipate any issue resolving these before the 3.14.0 final release. The draft PEPs defining the Emscripten platform (PEP 776) and Emscripten wheel tagging (PEP 783) have not seen any major progress.</p>
<p>Our students from Curtin University have concluded their first semester of work, providing implementations for a range of Toga widgets on the web platform, finding (and resolving) a number of bugs along the way. They've also made a number of small improvements to Briefcase. As part of their work, they've laid out plans for more substantial contributions in the second half of the year. These contributions should result in significant improvements to the development experience for Toga's web backend.</p>
<p>We also saw a lot of unexpected improvements in BeeWare's documentation and website. We now have a much improved translation infrastructure for BeeWare's website. A significant review of the structure of the documentation of the major BeeWare projects is also underway, addressing both visual consistency, and the integration of the documentation projects into the overall web presence of the BeeWare project.</p>
<p>Lastly, we had a successful PyCon US attendance, presenting multiple talks, a tutorials, and introducing a large number of people to Open Source contribution through the sprints.</p>
<h2>Q3 priorities</h2>
<p>In Q3, we will have two major areas of focus for BeeWare development.</p>
<p>The first, unsurprisingly, is to continue working on binary packaging. We'll continue working on the cibuildwheel patch to support building Android wheels; and we'll continue the process of submitting patches for iOS support to notable packages. Some of this work is dependent on formal releases of meson and meson-python; we'll progress as fast as the published state of the ecosystem allows.</p>
<p>The second area of focus is generating iOS and Android binary artefacts as part of the CPython release process. This will hopefully also involve integrating iOS and Android into CPython's pre-merge CI tooling, which should limit the incidence of changes that are landed into CPython that break iOS and Android.</p>
<p>We'll also be attending EuroPython in July; PyCon AU, CPython core team summit and PyCon UK in September. These are important events for community outreach and for collaboration with other projects and the core team - but they'll obviously place constraints on the progress we make in the quarter.</p>
<h2>Longer term goals</h2>
<p>The long term goals of BeeWare remain largely the same. Once we've developed a compelling story for mobile binary packaging, we'll be able to turn our focus back to Toga. There's a number of navigation and data organization widgets that need to be developed; we also need to improve documentation of some common development patterns that are sources of common questions in BeeWare support channels. Unless pull requests are submitted from the broader community, it is unlikely that we'll make any substantial progress on this front until the end of this year, or perhaps early next year.</p>
<p>We're also intending to look at tooling other than <code>pip</code> and <code>venv</code> for building Briefcase packages. Integration with Conda is one obvious goal, as it provides rich tooling for distributing complex binary requirements. <code>uv</code> is another tool that might fit well in the Briefcase development story. Again, it is unlikely that we'll make any progress on this front before the end of this year.</p>

    le 1 July 2025 
  </p>
  
  <p>June has been a busy month, with some big improvements to BeeWare's websites and documentation, and some major milestones reached in our work on mobile packaging.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/cibuildwheel/3.0.0/">cibuildwheel 3.0</a> has been released - including iOS support! As a result, we've been able to submit pull requests for <a href="https://github.com/amitdev/lru-dict/pull/73">lru-dict</a> and <a href="https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/pull/9030">Pillow</a>, proposing the addition of iOS support. Work on <a href="https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/pull/2349">adding Android support</a> is still underway.</li>
<li>An <a href="https://buildbot.python.org/#/builders/1810">Emscripten CPython buildbot is now live</a>! The buildbot is currently failing 2 tests; but having a buildbot <em>at all</em> is a major step towards restoring Tier-3 support, and will help detect regressions on Emscripten as a platform.</li>
<li>We've started a big review of the structure of our documentation, with a view to resolving a number of inconsistencies between platforms. This review will also involve a visual refresh, making BeeWare docs have a style consistent with the homepage; and improvements to how the documentation for BeeWare's individual projects fit into the overall BeeWare website. </li>
<li>We added <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2336">iCloud detection to Briefcase</a>. iCloud Drive synchronisation adds metadata to some folders that prevents signing infrastructure from working; this has been a recurring source of problems during tutorials.</li>
<li>We massively <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2284">improved file type associations for macOS</a>. Briefcase previously supported macOS file associations, but expressed some very specific opinions on how files would be used. With these new improvements, it should be possible to support almost any macOS file type association requirements that an application might have.</li>
<li>We modified Briefcase so <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2333">it can package, sign and notarise applications that weren't built with Briefcase</a>. We've spent a lot of time automating the processes for building installers, and for managing signing and notarization - and almost none of that work depends on using Briefcase to build the app being packaged. With these modifications, you can now point Briefcase at an app that was built with a different tool, and Briefcase will manage the packaging and signing that is required.</li>
<li>We've started the process of <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2355">upgrading Briefcase to use a newer version of WiX for Windows MSI packaging</a>.</li>
<li>We added a <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3527">Slider widget to the Web backend</a>.</li>
<li>We added a DateInput widget to the <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3483">iOS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3574">macOS</a> backends.</li>
<li>We added a TimeInput widget to the <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3536">iOS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3574">macOS</a> backends.</li>
<li>We added an <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3473">ActivityIndicator widget to the WinForms backend</a>.</li>
<li>We modified the handling of Toga app paths so that <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3543">requesting a path guarantees that it exists</a>. This is a significant improvement to user experience, as it's no longer necessary to "check and create" every time you access an app path.</li>
<li>We resolved a long-standing instability in the macOS and iOS testbed app that <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3557">caused intermittent failures in the WebView tests</a></li>
<li>We added a new <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3552">topic guide on managing file system access in Toga apps</a>.</li>
<li>We modified the handling of font specifications in Toga apps. You can now provide <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3526">a list of fonts</a>, as you would in CSS, and the first available font in that list will be used.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3570">corrected a number of issues with document-based apps</a>. This was detected while upgrading Podium, BeeWare's slide presentation tool, to use a recent version of Toga.</li>
<li>Our Curtin students <a href="https://beeware.org/news/buzz/2025-curtin-capstone-semester-end-blog/">delivered their mid-year report</a> - including plans for the work they're intending to complete in the second half of the year.</li>
<li>We completed the process of migrating BeeWare's core projects to use Ruff, rather than a combination of flake8, sort, pyupgrade, and more.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>With the public release of cibuildwheel 3.0, we've been able to start submitting pull requests upstream for projects to officially support iOS. In July, we'll continue that work, with the aim of having some official iOS wheels for major projects that <em>aren't</em> published by BeeWare. We'll also continue working on adding Android support to cibuildwheel, with the hope that it will be included in version 3.1.</p>
<p>We're also hoping to start the process of integrating the production of iOS and Android binary artefacts into Python releases. This will hopefully also involve integrating iOS and Android into CPython's pre-merge CI tooling, which will hopefully limit the incidence of changes that are landed into CPython that break iOS and Android.</p>
<p>We'll also be attending EuroPython, where we will be <a href="https://ep2025.europython.eu/session/building-a-cross-platform-app-with-beeware">giving a tutorial</a>, attending the <a href="https://ep2025.europython.eu/session/webassembly-summit">WebAssembly summit</a>, and <a href="https://ep2025.europython.eu/sprints/">running a BeeWare sprint</a>. If you can make it  to Prague in July, <a href="https://ep2025.europython.eu/tickets/">tickets are still available</a> - we hope to see you there!</p>

  </p>
  
  <p>Over the past semester, a team of final year students from <a href="https://www.curtin.edu.au">Curtin University</a> has been collaborating with the BeeWare Project as part of a capstone project for their degrees. Here's a summary of what they've done so far this semester, and what they have planned for the rest of the year.</p>
<h2>Curtin Capstone</h2>
<p>Capstone is the final year project undertaken by students across all computing disciplines at Curtin University, including Computer Science, Software Engineering, Cyber Security, and Information Technology. It allows students the opportunity to work in teams on real-world projects in collaboration with industry partners, gaining practical experience and professional exposure before graduating.</p>
<p>This year our team has had the exciting opportunity to contribute to BeeWare for our Capstone project.</p>

<h2>What We’ve Worked On</h2>
<p>This year, our primary focus has been on improving Toga’s Web backend and enhancing Briefcase’s support for that backend.</p>
<p>Throughout the first semester, our team has been focused on contributing to issues on Briefcase and Toga while working on our research to prepare for what is to come in the following semester. We’ve also worked on implementing several of the Toga Web widgets to enhance functionality on the web backend before working on the web test suite for next semester.</p>
<p>We were first tasked with contributing to a first timer issue before moving on to other more advanced issues.</p>

</ul>
<h2>What We're Working Towards</h2>
<p>Now that we’re more familiar with the BeeWare ecosystem, through both our initial PRs and widget implementations, and having concluded our Semester 1 research phase, we’re shifting our focus to larger, more structural improvements for the second half of the project.</p>
<p>Our primary goals moving forward include:</p>
<h3>Toga Web Testing</h3>
<p>Toga does not currently support testing for the web platform as the test suite and testbed app run multithreaded in the same process. The web platform is incompatible with this as WebAssembly does not support multithreading. To address this, we are working on developing a general approach that allows the test suite and testbed app to run in separate processes. This will include using proxy objects in place of Toga objects in the test suite that will wrap the respective object in the testbed app, forwarding commands to it in order to change its state and retrieve data.</p>
<p>Additionally, to verify the rendered state of the testbed app, we plan to use Playwright to inspect the browser's DOM and compare it against what the test suite expects. This setup should allow the web platform to be effectively tested while still using the existing test suite.</p>
<p>More technical details and discussion can be found in our <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/discussions/3440">Discussion Post</a> on Toga and the associated <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/3545">Issue Ticket</a>.</p>
<h3>PyScript Briefcase and Toga Dependencies</h3>
<p>During Mitchell’s development of the DateInput Web Widget, we discovered some issues resulting from how PyScript APIs were being used. This issue was resolved separately but sparked broader discussions about the ownership of PyScript, Shoelace, and Bootstrap within the wider BeeWare architecture. Currently, the Briefcase web template includes these directly in <code>index.html</code>, but they should ideally be managed as dependencies of Toga.</p>
<p>We’re proposing to shift ownership of these dependencies to Toga and other toolkits, enabling them to define their own configurations and inserts while keeping Briefcase focused purely on packaging. This would allow for clearer version control, better modularity, and easier maintenance across the ecosystem. This approach builds on prior work (<a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1285">briefcase#1285</a>, <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1945">toga#1945</a> and <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase-web-static-template/pull/9">briefcase-web-static-template#9</a>) and introduces a mechanism for toolkit-managed inserts and configuration. We plan on reviving parts of these to allow for Toga to specify PyScript versioning.</p>
<p>More technical details and discussion can be found in our <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/discussions/2283">Discussion Post</a> on Briefcase and the associated <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2337">Issue Ticket</a>.</p>
<h3>Briefcase Web Development Optimisations</h3>
<p>While contributing to Toga's web widgets, we noticed that testing even small changes requires rebuilding all project wheels (with <code>briefcase run web -r -u</code>), which can take a significant amount of time. This makes local development slow and interrupts the feedback loop needed for efficient frontend iteration.</p>
<p>To improve this we're going to be working on extending the <code>dev</code> command to be platform aware and make it so <code>dev web</code> utilises editbale installs to serve your project to the brower making it so with simple refresh of the browser you can quickly see your changes instead of waiting for a full wheel rebuild.</p>
<p>More technical details and discussion can be found in our <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/discussions/2282">Discussion Post</a> on Briefcase and the associated <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2334">Issue Ticket</a>.</p>

  </p>
  
  <p>During May, BeeWare saw a number of major improvements - many of which came as a result of our attendance at PyCon US 2025.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul>
<li>We attended PyCon US! We gave presentations at the Language Summit and the Packaging Summit, presented a tutorial, presented in the main conference track, and spent time in the Anaconda booth demonstrating BeeWare. After all that, we ran a 3 day sprint, during which 19 new contributors earned their challenge coins, and a bunch of existing contributors returned to contribute as well. Many of the contributions described in this blog post come from PyCon US contributions.</li>
<li>Our proposed changes to <a href="https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/pull/14541">Meson</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson-python/pull/731">Meson-python</a> have all been accepted, and will be included in the next releases of those tools. There have been some other conversations with the Meson team that have led to some minor improvements in the features added to support mobile binary packaging.</li>
<li>We made a major set of updates to the BeeWare website, <a href="https://github.com/beeware/beeware.github.io/pull/629">transitioning all the content to Markdown</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/beeware/beeware.github.io/pull/637">moving the translation infrastructure to Weblate</a>.</li>
<li>We modified the Briefcase new project wizard to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2271">draw default values from a user's Git configuration, where possible</a></li>
<li>We modified Briefcase's handling of licenses to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2272">use SPDX standard abbreviations</a></li>
<li>We optimised the handling of signing on macOS to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2302">remove a redundant ad hoc signing pass when packaging an app</a></li>
<li>We improved <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2305">warnings for users who have an old version of Python</a>, which would result in them having an old version of Briefcase, but be unaware of this fact.</li>
<li>We modified Briefcase to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2308">use the system certificate store</a>. This should remove a very common source of errors on some corporate-managed VPNs. We also improved error handling to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2318">provide more context for any remaining SSL or related connection errors</a>.</li>
<li>We improved error messages when <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2303">one of the required wheels can't be found on iOS and macOS</a></li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3472">corrected the events that are generated by Tables on Windows</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3471">improved the error handling when an app doesn't return valid window content as part of its startup method</a></li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3467">added a mechanism for detecting dark mode on Android</a></li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3359">significantly improved the handling of type annotations</a>, allowing for Toga's lazy loading main module.</li>
<li>We made some modifications to the WebView widget, <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3400">adding support for setting content at time of construction</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3401">simplifying the interface for setting static content</a></li>
<li>Our student contributors have continued to work on Toga's web backend. They've added new <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3405">TimeInput</a> widget, and they've begun planning some larger contributions to Briefcase and Toga to improve the tools for testing the Web backend. There should be a blog post in a couple of weeks that details their plans for the remainder of the year.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>For most this year, we've been trying to get the pieces in place to support binary packaging on mobile platforms. We're now at a point where the code required to support iOS is mostly in place; and the code to support Android is <em>almost</em> in place; however, it will be difficult to make further progress until those changes are available in public releases.</p>
<p>So, in June, we'll be changing focus. We're aiming to take a look at Briefcase, with 2 major improvements in mind. Firstly, we want to upgrade our Windows packaging story, and upgrade our WiX support from WiX 3 to a current version. This should resolve some issues with packaging large apps and apps with lots of files; it should also enable us to package applications for ARM64. Secondly, we've had some requests to expose Briefcase's packaging and signing infrastructure so it can be used on projects that <em>aren't</em> built with Briefcase - we're hoping to add this as well.</p>
<p>We're also hoping to follow up on some of our discussion with the Python core team at PyCon, and begin the process of integrating the production of iOS and Android binary artefacts into Python releases. This will hopefully also involve integrating iOS and Android into CPython's pre-merge CI tooling, which will hopefully limit the incidence of changes that are landed into CPython that break iOS and Android.</p>
<p>Lastly, we'll continue to work on Python Emscripten support. Last month, we thought we were one issue away from a working buildbot; however, some new issues have emerged since then. We still hope to have a working buildbot before 3.14 is finalised, which will restore Emscripten to Tier 3 status.</p>

  </p>
  
  <p>April was a shortened development month due to the Easter break, plus
some other employer-related travel commitments, but we've still been
able to make some important progress in the BeeWare ecosystem.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul>
<li>We contributed changes to <a href="https://github.com/numpy/meson/pull/19">the Meson
buildsystem</a> that support
building on iOS; we have a <a href="https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/pull/14541">second set of
changes</a> in review. We
also have an <a href="https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson-python/pull/731">iOS support PR for
Meson-python</a>,
the library that provides the PEP 517 build interface for Meson-based
Python projects. Work on the <a href="https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/28759">patch for NumPy to support iOS
builds</a> also continued.</li>
<li>We landed some changes to CPython's iOS testbed to <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/133132">accommodate
changes introduced in Xcode
16.3</a>.</li>
<li>We modified CPython's iOS compiler shims to ensure <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/133184">better support for
enforcing minimum iOS version
levels</a>.</li>
<li>We contributed some improvements to CPython's build system to clean up
<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/133081">warnings due to over-specified linking
requirements</a>.</li>
<li>We modified CPython's usage of the HACL* hashing library to <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/133226">use a
safer memory clearing implementation on
iOS</a>.</li>
<li>We made some improvements to CPython's Android build script to <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/133193">make
it more resilient to network
failures</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/pip/25.1/">pip 25.1 was released</a>, including
support for Android packaging.</li>
<li>We completed work on a patch to allow the <a href="https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/pull/2317">declaration of tools that
are needed by the iOS build
process</a>.</li>
<li>We've submitted the first parts of a <a href="https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/pull/2349">patch to add Android build
support to
cibuildwheel</a>. This is
getting close to being ready to submit for review, but still requires
some additional work.</li>
<li>We added <a href="https://github.com/beeware/Python-Apple-support/pull/270">support for
visionOS</a>;
support for MacCatalyst <a href="https://github.com/freakboy3742/cpython/pull/8">is also
underway</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3344">updated the Textual
backend</a>. This resolved a
number of small issues that had emerged as a result of changes in
Textual.</li>
<li>Briefcase has been modified to accept <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2229">more names for change log
files</a>.</li>
<li>Briefcase can now <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2239">enforce a minimum OS version on iOS, macOS and
Android</a>. This is an
important feature for ensuring the availability of OS-level features.</li>
<li>Our student contributors have been investigating the current state of
Toga's web backend, and Briefcase's tools for running and testing that
backend. They've already landed a new
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3338">DateInput</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3362">ScrollContainer</a> widget,
and they've started the process of updating the web backend to make
better use of Pyscript APIs, <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3345">resolving a number of errors with event
handling</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>Our focus for May will be preparing for and attending PyCon US. We've
already spent some time in April getting prepared for the
<a href="https://us.pycon.org/2025/schedule/presentation/78/">talk</a> and
<a href="https://us.pycon.org/2025/schedule/presentation/147/">tutorial</a> that
we're presenting, as well as a presentation to the Language Summit; we
also hope to be attending the Packaging Summit to discuss issues related
to cross-platform build environments. We'll be around the Anaconda booth
in the main hall at various times, and we'll be at the first three days
of the sprints. Tickets are still available - we hope to see you there!</p>
<p>Allowing for travel time, just attending PyCon US will take up almost 2
weeks of May. For the rest of the month, we'll be continuing to work on
binary packaging - iOS patches for NumPy (including the tools to build
NumPy) are almost complete. Android support in cibuildwheel is also
progressing; once those changes are in place, and a cibuildwheel version
with iOS and Android support has been officially released, we will be
able to start officially submitting patches to upstream projects to
support iOS and Android.</p>
<p>Progress on Python Emscripten support stalled this month due to other
commitments. The Emscripten buildbot is still ready to launch, with one
last technical issue to resolve. We hope we'll be able to resolve this
before or at PyCon US.</p>

  <h2><a href="/fr_FR/news/buzz/2025q2-roadmap/">2025Q2 Roadmap</a></h2>
  <p class="meta">
    Posté par
    
      <a href="https://cloudisland.nz/@freakboy3742">Russell Keith-Magee</a>
    
    le 3 April 2025 
  </p>
  
  <p>In Q1, BeeWare hit some major milestones for support of iOS and Android
on mobile platforms; but we still have more work to do. As always, this
roadmap should be read as a guide to what we aim to focus on over the
coming quarter, rather than a hard commitment of features that will be
made available on a specific deadline.</p>
<h2>Q1 progress</h2>
<p>In Q1, we made major progress in the state of binary packaging for iOS
and Android. PyPI now accepts binary wheel uploads; and we have uploaded
wheels for one package (pyspamsum) to prove that this support works.
We've also contributed changes in cibuildwheel that supports the
creation of iOS binary wheels. We need to wait until those changes are
in an official cibuildwheel release before we can contribute patches
upstream for other projects, but we have patches for a couple of
projects ready to submit as soon as there is an official release to use.
We've completed some preparatory work in CPython and pip to support
building Android binary wheels, but the changes to cibuildwheel to
support Android wheels are still in the early stages of development.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, our collaboration with the PyScript team didn't work out
as expected; the opportunity to work with the PyScript team that we
anticipated did not eventuate. However, a group of students from Curtin
University will be working on Toga's web backend as part of their final
year capstone project. This will include making modifications to
Briefcase to support testing web-based apps. This project will run until
the end of the year; we look forward to seeing the progress they're able
to make.</p>
<p>However, we <em>have</em> made good progress on Emscripten support in CPython.
A buildbot for Emscripten is almost ready to launch; having a stable
buildbot is a major milestone in restoring Emscripten to Tier 3 support
in CPython. Draft PEPs defining the Emscripten platform (PEP 776) and
Emscripten wheel tagging (PEP 783) are currently in discussion.</p>
<h2>Q2 priorities</h2>
<p>In Q2, we're planning to continue working on binary packaging for mobile
platforms. This work will take three forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>We'll continue working on the cibuildwheel patch to support building
Android wheels. Now that the iOS patch has landed in cibuildwheel,
we're in a position to use that patch as a template for the analogous
changes needed to support Android.</li>
<li>We'll continue to work on generating patches to third-party projects
to prove that the tooling we've developed for mobile binary wheels is
sufficient to support the entire Python ecosystem. We're currently
working on Numpy; Cryptography will likely be the next project we look
into.</li>
<li>We will start the process of formalising and standardising the work
that we've done to support iOS and Android packaging. With PyCon US
approaching rapidly, we want to get these discussions underway so that
we can make the most of the opportunity provided by having a large
portion of the Python community in one place. There are two major
areas that require formalisation - the production of official binaries
for iOS and Android support; and the state of cross-platform build
environments.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the work we're doing on mobile binary wheels, we're
expecting to work on improving Briefcase, with a view to making
Briefcase's tooling for packaging, signing and notarization useful as
standalone utilities, without the need to use Briefcase to package the
entire app.</p>
<h2>Longer term goals</h2>
<p>The long term goals of BeeWare remain largely the same. Once we've
developed a compelling story for mobile binary packaging, we'll be able
to turn our focus back to Toga. There's a number of navigation and data
organization widgets that need to be developed; we also need to improve
documentation of some common development patterns that are sources of
common questions in BeeWare support channels. Unless pull requests are
submitted from the broader community, it is unlikely that we'll make any
substantial progress on this front until the end of this year, or
perhaps early next year.</p>
<p>We're also intending to look at tooling other than <code>pip</code> and <code>venv</code> for
building Briefcase packages. Integration with Conda is one obvious goal,
as it provides rich tooling for distributing complex binary
requirements. <code>uv</code> is another tool that might fit well in the Briefcase
development story. Again, it is unlikely that we'll make any progress on
this front before the end of this year.</p>
