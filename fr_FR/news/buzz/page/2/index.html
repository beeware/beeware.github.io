    le 1 November 2024 
  </p>
  
  <p>In October, BeeWare saw some important releases, plus more good progress
on binary packaging for iOS.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul>
<li>Most importantly, we released <a href="https://pypi.org/project/briefcase/0.3.20/">Briefcase
0.3.20</a> and <a href="https://pypi.org/project/toga/0.4.8/">Toga
0.4.8</a>, including support for
Python 3.13 - which includes the official support in Python for iOS
and Android! This is a major milestone for BeeWare as a project,
representing a significant portion of the work done over the last 12
months.</li>
<li>We've prepared an <a href="https://github.com/freakboy3742/cibuildwheel/tree/ios-support">initial patch to cibuildwheel that is able to build
and test simple iOS
wheels</a>.
This patch isn't ready to submit upstream, but it is able to build
simple iOS wheels.</li>
<li>We've submitted a patch to Pillow to <a href="https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/pull/8497">isolate its build system from
Homebrew when building on
macOS</a>. This is
essential for iOS support, as it's easy for Homebrew macOS ARM64
binaries to leak into iOS builds; but it also has benefits for macOS
builds.</li>
<li>We've made <a href="https://github.com/multi-build/multibuild">a number of improvements to
multibuild</a>, the tooling
that Pillow uses to compile non-Python binary dependencies.</li>
<li>We've <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/126169">modified the CPython iOS testbed
project</a> so that it can
be used as a testbed for <em>any</em> iOS Python project.</li>
<li>We've <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2033">improved error reporting when Briefcase can't clone a
template</a>.</li>
<li>We've switched to using <code>httpx</code> instead of <code>requests</code> for <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2041">Briefcase's
internal download
handling</a>. This
provides slightly better error handling, better options for improving
HTTP/2 usage, and we're now consistently using <code>httpx</code> in Briefcase
and in our example code.</li>
<li>We've modified Toga to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2686">lazily load
components</a>, rather than
importing everything into the <code>toga</code> namespace at startup. This should
improve application startup times, especially on platforms like mobile
and web where this startup time is noticeable.</li>
<li>We resolved an issue causing <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2893">intermittent test failures when testing
Toga on Wayland</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>We will be continuing to work on binary packaging in November. We're
using Pillow as a demonstrator for this work - it's a package that has a
significant binary component, is widely used (including on mobile), but
has a non-trivial build process (largely due to the non-Python binary
dependencies). The hope is that by the time we're able to compile Pillow
for iOS, we will have resolved many of the issues facing other binary
packages. Our goal remains to have at least <em>some</em> third-party projects
officially supporting iOS and Android by the end of the year, but this
may be impeded by the sequence of dependencies that need to land and be
published before upstream projects can accept iOS and Android patches.</p>
<p>We'll also be speaking at <a href="https://2024.pycon.org.au">PyCon AU</a> at the
end of the month, including attending both days of the sprints. If
you're able to make it to Narrm/Melbourne, we hope we'll see you there!</p>

    le 2 October 2024 
  </p>
  
  <p>Q3 has seen some major progress against long term goals of the BeeWare
project. As always, this roadmap should be read as a guide to what we
aim to focus on over the coming quarter, rather than a hard commitment
of features that will be made available on a specific deadline.</p>
<h2>Q3 progress</h2>
<p>In Q3 the biggest milestone we achieved was the finalisation of Tier 3
support for Android in CPython. The last of the compatibility and
documentation issues associated with Android have been resolved, and
Android buildbots are now running for both x86_64 and ARM64. Python
3.13.0 is due for release in about a week; we should be in a position to
support this release very soon after the official release.</p>
<p>We've also made significant progress on binary packaging. We've
backported all the Python 3.13 patches for iOS into BeeWare's support
for Python 3.9-3.12, and we've updated our Mobile Forge infrastructure
to generate binary wheels for a number of popular packages. We've
developed iOS compatibility patches for pip and crossenv; these patches
have been submitted and received initial reviews; we'll continue to work
with those projects to land these patches upstream.</p>
<h2>Q4 priorities</h2>
<p>In Q4, we'll be focussing on the tools and documentation needed to for
third-party Python packages to add Android and iOS support to their
official CI and release processes. In addition to contributing to tools
like <code>pip</code> and <code>cibuildwheel</code>, we'll develop the tools and documentation
needed so that it is easy to add CI configurations for mobile platforms.
The hope is that by the end of the year, there will be at least one
third-party package that produces Android and iOS wheels without any
direct involvement of the BeeWare team.</p>
<h2>Longer term goals</h2>
<p>Once we've got a strong story for packaging third-party packages for iOS
and Android, we'll be able to turn our focus back to Toga, and the work
needed to make iOS and Android compelling app development platforms.
There's a number of navigation and data organization widgets that need
to be developed; we also need to improve documentation of some common
development patterns that are sources of common questions in BeeWare
support channels.</p>
<p>There are also further improvements that we'd like to see in Python
itself. This year we've been able to get Android and iOS to Tier 3
support; getting those platforms to Tier 2 is an obvious goal for future
Python releases. We'd also like to contribute the tooling needed so that
Python is able to distribute official binary releases of iOS and
Android, and add an official macOS artefact that mirrors the "Windows
embedded" installer. We've had discussions with the Python core team
about how this could be achieved; over the coming year, we hope to land
these changes.</p>



  
  
  <h2><a href="/fr_FR/news/buzz/september-2024-status-update/">September 2024 Status Update</a></h2>
  <p class="meta">
    Posté par
    
      <a href="https://cloudisland.nz/@freakboy3742">Russell Keith-Magee</a>
    
    le 1 October 2024 
  </p>
  
  <p>In September, BeeWare hit an important milestone for Android support,
made good progress on packaging for iOS, and landed some significant
changes to Toga.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul>
<li>Android is <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0011/#tier-3">now officially a Tier 3 platform in
CPython</a>! Over the last
month, we've resolved a number of bugs that were preventing us from
deploying a reliable buildbot for Android (on both x86_64 and ARM64);
as a result, the CPython buildbot fleet now contains Android
buildbots. The Android-related changes to documentation have also been
merged; Python 3.13.0rc3 (due for release any day now) will
incorporate all these changes.</li>
<li>We completed the <a href="https://github.com/beeware/mobile-forge/pull/55">updates to Mobile Forge to support the new official
iOS wheel format</a>,
and published updated wheels in this format for the packages for which
we have recipes. As part of these changes, we've also added CI checks
to Mobile Forge.</li>
<li>We've <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/12962">submitted a patch to support iOS in
pip</a>. This patch also requires
some patches to
<a href="https://github.com/pypa/packaging/pull/832">packaging</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/pypa/distlib/pull/231">distlib</a> that pip includes
as vendored copies.</li>
<li>We've <a href="https://github.com/benfogle/crossenv/pull/117">submitted a patch to
crossenv</a> that allows
cross-compiling Python packages for iOS. There is some additional work
required before this patch can land - crossenv's testing framework is
currently broken, so it's not currently possible to verify changes
in CI. We'll be working on restoring this testing support in the very
near future.</li>
<li>We attended the CPython core team summit. During this week-long
sprint, we were able to resolve a number of open questions about
Python support on mobile, and begin planning for work that will
hopefully be incorporated into the Python 3.14 release.</li>
<li>We released <a href="https://pypi.org/project/toga/0.4.7/">Toga 0.4.7</a>,
incorporating fixes for a number of bugs discovered in the recent
0.4.6 release, as well as some minor feature additions.</li>
<li>We transitioned Toga's GTK backend to use <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2550">PyGObject's native asyncio
support</a>. This allowed us
to deprecate <a href="https://github.com/beeware/gbulb">Gbulb</a>, the GTK
asyncio plugin that we've been maintaining for several years.</li>
<li>We corrected an issue with the <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2822">use of recent Textual versions in
Toga</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2823">added a
bare-bones runtime test</a> to
ensure that the problem doesn't re-occur. This also required a fix for
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1992">macOS console app testing in
Briefcase</a>.</li>
<li>We made some <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2831">usability improvements to the rendering of Toga's
documentation</a>, and
modified Toga's ReadTheDocs configuration to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2833">encourage search engines
to return the stable documentation by
default</a>.</li>
<li>We modified the handling of Toga's app icons on macOS to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2852">improve
compatibility with
PyInstaller</a>.</li>
<li>We corrected a number of issues with WebView handling, including
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2815">ensuring that DOM storage is always
available</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2781">improving
error handling when the WebView cannot be initialised on
Windows</a>.</li>
<li>We added protection against an edge case of asynchronous Task handling
that could lead to the <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2814">premature garbage collection of long lived
tasks</a>. We've also had some
discussions with the CPython core team about <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/121264">fixing this problem in
Python itself</a>.</li>
<li>We spoke at <a href="https://pybay.org">PyBay</a> on building mobile apps in
Python.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>In October, we will continuing working on binary package support for
mobile platforms. In addition to responding to any review feedback on
the patches we've already submitted, we'll be working on new patches for
<code>cibuildwheel</code> and <code>meson-python</code>, as well as tooling to make it easy
for third-party libraries to run CPython test suites on mobile
platforms. We should also be able finalise Briefcase's Python 3.13
support for Android, and start work on Android packaging. Supporting
packaging for mobile platforms is a long term project which we expect to
continue for several months; the hope is that by the end of the year, we
will be able to contribute patches to third-party projects so that iOS
and Android wheels become officially produced, rather than
BeeWare-maintained artefacts.</p>

    le 1 September 2024 
  </p>
  
  <p>August has seen some good progress on BeeWare's support for Python 3.13,
plus a number of long-awaited features landing in a stable release of
Toga.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul>
<li>We've completed the process of backporting the CPython changes for iOS
compatibility to Python 3.9 through 3.12. We've published support
packages and stub binaries that incorporate these changes, and made
the <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1934">changes to Briefcase needed to support these new
versions</a>.</li>
<li>We've begun work on updating Mobile Forge and related binary tooling
to support the new official binary tag and framework format required
by the PEP-compliant patch for iOS support. So far, we're able to
compile simple binary packages like <code>lru-dict</code>, and non-Python
dependencies like <code>libjpeg</code>; we're working on restoring binary support
for more complex binary dependencies.</li>
<li>We've landed the <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/121595">Android test runner
script</a>, fixed a number
of issues that have arisen in CPython's Android support since the
original patches landed, and <a href="https://buildbot.python.org/#/builders/1594">deployed an Android CPython
buildbot</a>. This buildbot
has revealed some edge cases (primarily in socket and signal handling)
that only appear to manifest under the unusual load conditions
generated by a buildbot; so, we've temporarily disabled the buildbot
while we investigate the cause of these problems.</li>
<li>We completed work on <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2666">a new API for document-based
apps</a>.</li>
<li>We completed work on <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2768">an API for status icon
apps</a>.</li>
<li>We released <a href="https://pypi.org/project/toga/0.4.6/">Toga 0.4.6</a>. This
includes the support for document-based apps, status icon apps, and a
number of other long-awaited features, such as apps without menubars,
available in a stable release.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2764">updated the support for WebView on
Windows</a> to a more recent
version, and <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2778">resolved an issue with compatibility with Windows Store
Python</a>.</li>
<li>We diagnosed and contributed fixes for a number of issues in tools
that BeeWare depends on for our build tooling. This includes updates
to CI configurations to support Sphinx 8, <a href="https://github.com/crate/sphinx_csv_filter/pull/49">fixes for Sphinx 8 support
in a Sphinx
plugin</a>, and

</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>In September, we'll be continuing work on binary package support for
mobile platforms. Once we've restored support for binary wheels using
the new binary tag and framework format, and added support for Python
3.13, we'll start upstreaming the changes we've made so that the wider
Python ecosystem can start supporting iOS and Android. We'll also start
working on the fixes to tools like <code>pip</code>, <code>cibuildwheel</code>, and
<code>meson-python</code> that need to have explicit iOS support. We expect that
this work will be ongoing for several months, but some of the work
should be submitted upstream for review by the end of the month.</p>
<p>We'll also be presenting at talk at <a href="https://pybay.org">PyBay</a> in San
Francisco on mobile app development in Python, followed by the CPython
core team sprint.</p>

  </p>
  
  <p>July saw a lot of our attention being consumed by the upcoming Python
3.13 release; but we've also seen some other improvements to the BeeWare
suite.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul>
<li>We've resolved a number of issues with iOS and Android compatibility
in CPython 3.13. Although patches for iOS and Android compatibility
landed months ago, a number of changes have been landed since then
which have inadvertently broken compatibility with these platforms.
These issues usually indicate a subtle issue with the implementation
of the feature that has been added - but diagnosing and correcting the
source of the problem can often take days. There have also been some
small improvements made to the iOS patches, such as a configuration
option <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/121947">ensuring App Store compliance for both iOS and
macOS</a>.</li>
<li>We've begun the process of backporting the CPython changes for iOS
compatibility to the older supported CPython releases. So far, we've
completed the port to 3.12, and the 3.11 port is mostly complete;
backports for 3.10 and 3.9 should be underway shortly. This includes
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/Python-Apple-support/pull/191">significant changes to the
Python-Apple-support</a>
repository, switching the build of the macOS support package to be
based on the official CPython download, and adding a CI test suite
that can be used to simplify the process of making a new release.</li>
<li>We've almost completed adding a <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/121595">test runner script for
Android</a>. This will
form the basis for an Android CPython buildbot in the very near
future.</li>
<li>We've added support for <a href="https://github.com/beeware/cpython-apple-source-deps/commit/f2bb2149098083f84da3993db86d1106b90d9456">using an externally managed libmpdec
implementation</a>
to the iOS patch. This is a change that was <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/115119">recently introduced to
CPython</a>, and will
become required in CPython 3.15.</li>
<li>We've <em>almost</em> completed work on <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2666">a new API for document-based
apps</a>.</li>
<li>We've developed an <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/97">initial design and prototype for status icon
apps</a>.</li>
<li>We've added an API to make it <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2714">easier to add and remove commands from
a Toga app</a>.</li>
<li>We corrected an issue that was causing <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2730">intermittent Toga CI failures
on macOS</a>.</li>
<li>We've improved Briefcase's <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1915">validation of the version of Git that a
user has installed</a>.</li>
<li>We've <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1910">corrected an issue with the way macOS signs
apps</a>. This was
causing problems with apps that have particularly complex application
layouts.</li>
<li>We've modified Briefcase to use the <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1929">newly available "stripped" Python
Standalone binaries on
Linux</a>.</li>
<li>We've <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1846">improved the validation of document type declarations in a
Briefcase project</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>In August, we'll be continuing preparations for the upcoming Python 3.13
release, and working on the mobile Python binary packaging ecosystem.
The initial release candidate for Python 3.13 will be released very
soon; with any luck, this means there should be less inadvertent
breakages to diagnose, so we can focus on improvements to tools like
<code>pip</code>, <code>cibuildwheel</code>, <code>meson-python</code> and more. We expect that this work
will take most of the rest of the quarter to release; but there should
be some initial signs of progress by the end of the month.</p>
<p>We'll also be at <a href="https://kiwipycon.nz">Kiwi PyCon</a>, presenting a
keynote about the future of Python.</p>

  <h2><a href="/fr_FR/news/buzz/2024q3-roadmap/">2024Q3 Roadmap</a></h2>
  <p class="meta">

      <a href="https://cloudisland.nz/@freakboy3742">Russell Keith-Magee</a>
    
    le 2 July 2024 
  </p>
  
  <p>We're halfway through the year, and BeeWare has seen another quarter of
significant progress. As always, this roadmap should be read as a guide
to what we aim to focus on over the coming quarter, rather than a hard
commitment of features that will be made available on a specific
deadline.</p>
<h2>Q2 progress</h2>
<p>The biggest news for the quarter is that iOS is now officially a Tier 3
supported platform in CPython. All the patches required for iOS
compatibility have been landed, and a buildbot is in place; as of
3.13.0b1, CPython will build for iOS without any patching. Android
support is close behind; the only missing piece is the buildbot.</p>
<p>We made some major improvements to the BeeWare tutorial, adding sections
on customization of the packaged app, and handling permissions for apps.
We were able to use these changes as part of a well-received tutorial at
PyCon US. We also ran a very successful booth and sprint at PyCon US.</p>
<p>We also completed a lot of improvements in Briefcase and Toga, expanding
the types of apps that can be supported. Briefcase can now package
console apps; and Toga now has an official API for apps that don't have
menu bars, background apps, and apps that aren't governed by the
lifecycle of a single "main" window. These have been the subject of
long-standing feature requests (some of them almost as old as Toga
itself), so it's great to be able to finally address these limitations.</p>
<p>The one area where we weren't able to make an progress was in packaging
for mobile platforms. However, we did have some very productive
discussions at PyCon US, so we're confident we'll be able to make good
progress on this in the coming quarter.</p>
<h2>Q3 priorities</h2>
<p>The highest priority for Q3 is to get ready for the Python 3.13 release
in early October. This involves finalising the work on the Android
buildbot so that Android is officially Tier 3; preparing Briefcase and
the Python builds that BeeWare supports to be ready for the 3.13
release; and doing as much work as we can on the packaging ecosystem so
that package maintainers can publish wheels for iOS and Android.</p>
<p>We'll also be attending <a href="https://kiwipycon.nz">Kiwi PyCon</a> in August,
and attending the Python Core Team summit in September.</p>
<h2>Longer term goals</h2>
<p>Getting the Python ecosystem to support iOS and Android is requires a
lot more than just adding patches to CPython and some related tools.
There will be a lot of education and support work required to help the
community adopt iOS and Android; and there is certain to be ongoing
maintenance as Python and the platforms evolve. There are also many ways
that Python mobile support could be made even better, including the
publication of official iOS and Android binaries, and potentially
getting to Tier 2 (or even Tier 1) support.</p>
<p>There's also a lot of work that can be done to Toga to make iOS and
Android compelling platforms to develop for. Toga is still missing some
key widgets to support navigation and data organization; and even when
these widgets exist, there will be a need for documentation and examples
to demonstrate how to build apps for these platforms. We anticipate
we'll be looking at these towards the end of the year. We also
anticipate that we'll start looking more seriously at Toga's web
backend, attempting to bring it to a level of support comparable to the
desktop and mobile platforms.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>It's been another busy quarter with a lot of progress, but as always,
there's still plenty to do. Completing official support for iOS and
Android means the foundational work needed to support mobile platforms
will be complete; we can then focus on what we - and the community -
build on that foundation.</p>

  </p>
  
  <p>In June, BeeWare made a lot of progress, landing lots of new features -
many of which have been the subject of requests and discussions for a
long time.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1781">added support for packaging console apps to
Briefcase</a>. This
involved adding a new <code>.pkg</code> packaging type for macOS, as well as a
number of other improvements to the stub app and MSI packaging on
Windows. In addition to providing a way to package console apps on
macOS, the addition of <code>.pkg</code> format means it is now possible to
distribute apps using centralised device management tooling (such as
Kandji or FleetDM).</li>
<li>We modified Briefcase to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1849">distribute the stub binaries as standalone
artefacts, rather than including them in the app
template</a>. We also
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1855">significantly optimised how Briefcase uses
templates</a>. Between
these two changes, the download size required for a first project on
macOS has been reduced from around 200MB, to less than 4MB.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1864">isolated Briefcase's use of
Cookiecutter</a> so that
all of Briefcase's cached content is contained in Briefcase's own
cache folder.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1856">added support for distribution certificates on
macOS</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2585">modified Toga's APIs to use namedtuple types for Size and Position
references</a>.</li>
<li>We corrected a number of stability issues with Toga's testbed CI, and
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2670">added CI testing for Wayland on
Linux</a>.</li>
<li>We completed a <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2252">major overhaul of typing in Toga's API
surface</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2642">added support for conditional coverage in Toga's
testing</a>. It is now
possible to get a clean coverage report without running the test suite
on every Python version and every platform.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2636">added an official API for customizing the system-installed menu
items</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1930">added an API for detecting the screens available for an app to
use, and for setting the position of windows relative to those
screens</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2649">added support for "simple"
apps</a> - apps that don't
have menu bars.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2651">added support for apps whose lifecycle isn't tied to a single
"Main" window</a>, such as
background apps (apps that don't have any windows) and document-based
apps.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2669">added support for app modal
dialogs</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>Work on Toga's App interface isn't quite finished - we're expecting to
finalise the Document API in the near future. Once that work is
complete, our focus will be the mobile Python binary packaging
ecosystem. The work we've done so far this year has led to CPython 3.13
formally supporting iOS and Android as Tier 3 supported platforms; the
next step is ensuring that the rest of the community can build iOS and
Android packages. This will involve improvements to tools like <code>pip</code>,
<code>cibuildwheel</code>, <code>meson-python</code> and more. We expect that this work will
take most of the rest of the quarter to release; but there should be
some initial signs of progress by the end of the month.</p>

  </p>
  
  <p>BeeWare activity in May was dominated by preparing for and attending
PyCon US in Pittsburgh. That event generated a lot of activity in the
BeeWare project - but we've also added some other significant
improvements.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul>
<li>We attended PyCon US. We presented on the <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2024/events/language-summit/">state of mobile support in
CPython to the Language
Summit</a>; we
<a href="https://us.pycon.org/2024/schedule/presentation/41/">presented a
tutorial</a> to over
30 attendees; we ran a booth in Community Row; we <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2024/schedule/presentation/40/">presented a
talk</a> on writing
a data visualisation app with BeeWare tools; and we ran an extremely
successful sprint. At the peak, we had over 30 people sprinting on
BeeWare projects; and we handed out over 20 challenge coins to first
time contributors. Many of the new features in this status update can
be attributed to contributions from sprint participants.</li>
<li>We modified Toga's Window API to allow <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2314">setting the content of the
window when the window is
constructed</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2591">improved
the APIs for replacing children in an existing window
layout</a>.</li>
<li>We modified how validation of TextInput widgets are handled so that
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2596">change handlers aren't invoked until validation has been
performed</a>.</li>
<li>We modified how the DetailedList is created on Android so that <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2595">the
dependency on the native SwipeRefreshLayout widget only exists if your
app actually uses a DetailedList
widget</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2590">improved the error handling around camera permissions on
macOS</a>, and ensured that
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1820">Briefcase will generate the right permissions for macOS
Sonoma</a>.</li>
<li>We diagnosed some issues associated with code signing on macOS <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1808">when
running on iCloud-mirrored
drives</a>, and when
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1831">Git has been configured to preserve Windows
newlines</a>. We also
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1825">improved the error handling when notarisation
fails</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1807">formally documented the plugin extension points that Briefcase
provides</a>. With this
formally documented interface, Pygame-CE and
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1834">PPB</a>, have taken
formal ownership of their Briefcase bootstraps.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1812">formally adopted PEP 621 format for specifying license files in
Briefcase</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1824">loosened the restrictions on bundle
identifiers</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1811">improved handling of applications with special characters in their
formal names</a>.</li>
<li>We developed a draft implementation of a change that will <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1781">allow
Briefcase to package console
applications</a>. We
expect this change will land in the next week or so, and be released
soon after that.</li>
<li>We started work on <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1849">removing binary stubs from the macOS and Windows
app templates</a>. This
was starting to become a significant performance issue for first-time
Briefcase users.</li>
<li>We improved the mechanism for invoking methods in Rubicon ObjC, making
it possible to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/pull/462">invoke methods with repeated argument
names</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>In June, we're expecting to see progress in three main areas.</p>
<p>Firstly, we'll be finalising the work on packaging console applications.
We expect to see a Briefcase release by mid month that will incorporate
this, and all the other improvements that have landed over the last
month.</p>
<p>Secondly, we'll be working on the APIs for the Toga App and Window
classes. We've already done <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2244">a lot of prototyping work in this
area</a>; once this work is
complete, Toga should have support for apps without a menubar in their
main window, support for status bar apps without a main window, vastly
improved abilities to customise standard menu items, and a stable API
for document-based apps.</p>
<p>Thirdly, we'll start looking at the broader CPython binary packaging
ecosystem. The work we've done so far this year has led to CPython 3.13
formally supporting iOS and Android as Tier 3 supported platforms; the
next step is ensuring that the rest of the community can build iOS and
Android packages. This will involve improvements to tools like <code>pip</code>,
<code>cibuildwheel</code>, <code>meson-python</code> and more. We expect that this work will
take much longer than a month to complete, but we hope to be able to
share some progress in June.</p>

  <p>This month has seen BeeWare reach one major milestone, almost reach a
second, as well as landing several smaller improvements.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul>
<li>iOS is <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0011/#tier-3">officially a Tier 3 supported platform for
CPython</a>! All the patches
needed to support iOS have been merged, and a <a href="https://buildbot.python.org/all/#/builders/1380">buildbot has been
deployed</a> to verify
that CPython can run on iOS. As a result, <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0730/">PEP 730 has been moved into
"Final" status</a>.</li>
<li>Android support in CPython is getting very close to completion. The
last three patches (adding a <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/117878">test harness for running the test suite
on Android</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/118063">redirecting stdout and stderr to the Android
log</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/118352">updating
sysconfig to support
Android</a>) are currently
in review; once those have been merged, and a buildbot has been
deployed, Android should also be at Tier 3 status.</li>
<li>We landed a new <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2462">Geolocation service for
Toga</a>, providing access to
GPS data on mobile devices and macOS.</li>
<li>We made some <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2527">modifications to how Toga handles application
icons</a>, removing the need
to duplicate the icon in application data. These changes are in final
review.</li>
<li>We added a new wizard to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1231">add a Briefcase configuration to an existing
Python project</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1751">modified how Briefcase handles splash screens on mobile
devices</a>, and
corrected some issues with icons seen on recent Android releases.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/pull/446">corrected a problem in Rubicon
ObjC</a> caused by a
change to the <code>ctypes</code> module in CPython 3.13. It might be possible to
upstream this fix to CPython itself; but for now, Rubicon ObjC is able
to support Python 3.13.0a6.</li>
<li>We drafted a new tutorial step about <a href="https://github.com/beeware/beeware/pull/327">customising application
appearance</a>. This update
is in review, and should be live in the near future.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>The bulk of May will be taken up by preparing for and attending PyCon
US. We're presenting a
<a href="https://us.pycon.org/2024/schedule/presentation/40/">talk</a> and a
<a href="https://us.pycon.org/2024/schedule/presentation/41/">tutorial</a>; we're
also <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2024/events/language-summit/">presenting at the Language
Summit</a>, we will have
a booth in the community section of the Expo Hall, and we'll be there
for the first 3 days of the sprints. If you're coming to Pittsburgh and
you'd like to attend that tutorial session, <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2024/attend/information/">ticket sales are
open!</a>. We're also hoping
that we'll be able to wrap up the work on Android support in CPython,
and start work on supporting command line applications in Briefcase.</p>

  <h2><a href="/fr_FR/news/buzz/2024q2-roadmap/">2024Q2 Roadmap</a></h2>
  <p class="meta">

    le 3 April 2024 
  </p>
  
  <p>Q1 2024 has seen some major progress - but as always, there's still
plenty of work to do. As always, this roadmap should be read as a guide
to what we aim to focus on over the coming quarter, rather than a hard
commitment of features that will be made available on a specific
deadline.</p>
<h2>Q1 progress</h2>
<p>The first quarter of 2024 has seen significant progress towards getting
iOS and Android to Tier 3 supported status in CPython. <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0738/">PEP
738</a> has been formally accepted by
the CPython steering committee, and the vast majority of the changes
needed to support <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/114099">iOS</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/116622">Android</a> have
either been merged, or received substantial review from the CPython core
team.</p>
<p>We've also made progress on a number of long standing feature requests
in Toga. We've added an OptionContainer for Android, so tab-based UIs
can be used on all platforms. We've added a MapView widget that works on
all desktop and mobile platforms. We've also added the start of hardware
APIs, including Camera and Geolocation APIs.</p>
<h2>Q2 priorities</h2>
<p>Our Q2 goals are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Get iOS and Android to Tier 3 supported status</strong>. We expect to
finish upstreaming the patches we have for CPython early in the
quarter. However, Tier 3 status also requires CI infrastructure to
verify that the platforms are stable. In Q2, we will commission
buildbots so that CPython's CI is able to verify the ongoing stability
of iOS and Android as a platform.</li>
<li><strong>Extend the BeeWare tutorial</strong>. The BeeWare tutorial provides a good
introduction to using Briefcase and Toga, but there are a number of
common support questions that aren't covered by the tutorial, and some
features that we've added since the tutorial last saw significant
edits. We're going to revisit the tutorial, adding some extra steps to
cover these new features and common issues.</li>
<li><strong>Attend PyCon US 2024</strong> We're presenting a tutorial and a talk; we
will have a booth in the community section; we'll be there for the
full duration of the sprints; and we're also expecting to attend the
language summit. It's going to be a busy 2 weeks - we hope we see you
there!</li>
<li><strong>Start working on packaging for mobile platforms</strong>. PEP 730 and PEP
738 cover the core of CPython itself, but Python is much more than
just the core interpreter and standard library. There's also the
ecosystem of third-party libraries, many of which have binary
components. In this quarter, we're going to start looking at the
changes that are needed to make it easy for the community to start
packaging wheels for iOS and Android.</li>
<li><strong>Modify the App class to support other types of apps</strong>. This includes
adding an API for a "Simple App" that doesn't have a menu bar,
finalising the API for document-based apps, and providing an API for
system tray apps.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Longer term goals</h2>
<p>Completing PEP 730 and 738 is a major milestone - but there's still a
lot of work to be done. It will take a lot of time and community
education before iOS and Android binary packages are widely available.
We intend to do whatever we can to support the community, ranging from
documentation, to tooling support, to submitting patches to upstream
packages.</p>
<p>One of the ways to accelerate this transition will be to make iOS and
Android compelling platforms to support. This means adding more
capabilities to Toga, so that there aren't any capability gaps for a
user writing an app. It also means writing more documentation and
tutorials so that common app development tasks are well explained.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This month marks 2 years since full-time work began on BeeWare; and 10
years since the first commits on the project. We've come a long way in
that time - from a collection of cobbled-together proof of concept
demonstrators to a fully tested GUI platform, with equally tested
deployment tooling, and official support in CPython itself. The future
for Python as a GUI development platform on desktop and mobile has never
looked better, and we're excited to see what the coming years will
bring.</p>
