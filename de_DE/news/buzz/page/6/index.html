  <p class="meta">
    Posted by
    
      <a href="https://cloudisland.nz/@freakboy3742">Russell Keith-Magee</a>
    
    on 3 October 2022 
  </p>
  
  <p>September has been a big month for the BeeWare team. There have been
lots of small updates - but there's one very large, eagerly anticipated
update that has taken several months to complete.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<p>During September:</p>
<ul>
<li>We added support for binary packages on mobile platforms! There's more
detail related to this than can fit in a bullet point; more details
below.</li>
<li>We added the ability to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/854">remove files from a templated
app</a>. This can be used
to trim down a project, removing parts of the Python interpreter that
you don't need (such as standard library modules that you don't need)</li>
<li>We've changed the way we use templates, switching to using <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/862">branches
based on the Briefcase release, rather than the Python
release</a>. This enables
us to make development changes to templates without affecting the
published stable release.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/801">reworked the way Briefcase manages integrations with the tools
needed to build apps</a>.
This was a mammoth project, but as a result the process of verifying
tools is faster, and a number of bugs related to having stale builds
have been resolved.</li>
<li>We've made a number of improvements to console handling of log
messages, especially on Windows</li>
<li>We improved error handling in Toga when <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1589">TLS1.2 or TLS1.3 isn't
supported by Windows</a>.</li>
<li>We started conversations with the teams at Anaconda responsible for
conda about using Conda as a base for Briefcase apps, and on using
Conde-forge style infrastructure to support binary packaging. Nothing
concrete has come from these conversations yet; these conversations
are ongoing.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Binary package support you say?</h3>
<p>All the new binary packaging support is contained in <a href="https://pypi.org/project/briefcase/0.3.10/">Briefcase
0.3.10</a>.</p>
<p>On Android, binary module support was achieved by moving to
<a href="https://chaquo.com">Chaquopy</a> as a base for Android projects. Along
with support for binary modules, this change has the added benefit of
faster startup times, and less bugs at runtime. This means you'll need
to re-generate any Android project - the Python source code should work
as-is, but there's no simple way to convert the Android Gradle project
from the older Rubicon base to the newer Chaquopy base.</p>
<p>On iOS, we've <a href="https://github.com/beeware/Python-Apple-support/pull/161">reworked how the support packages are
constructed</a>,
and <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/849">added support for installing binary modules from a BeeWare-specific
package repository that includes builds of iOS binary
wheels</a>. We've also added
asset signing to the iOS Xcode project - and applied the same changes to
the macOS backends. Of course, this also means you'll need to
re-generate any iOS project to take advantage of these changes.</p>
<p>While we are now able to support binary packages on mobile platforms,
this doesn't mean that <em>every</em> binary package is automatically
supported. Binary wheels need to be compiled for mobile platforms, and
compiling for mobile platforms can be complicated. However, we've
compiled ~40 of them most popular packages with binary components
(including numpy, pandas, cryptography, pillow and matplotlib), and made
them available as dependencies. In order to get working builds, some of
these packages are slightly older versions (e.g., cryptography is a
version from before the introduction of the rust dependency); however,
we've endeavoured to provide the most recent versions possible.</p>
<p>A full list of supported packages can be found <a href="https://chaquo.com/pypi-7.0/">on the Chaquopy package
repository for Android</a>, and the <a href="https://anaconda.org/beeware/repo">BeeWare
repository for iOS</a>. If your project
uses one of these packages, you only need to add them to the
<span class="title-ref">requires</span> definition in your
<span class="title-ref">pyproject.toml</span>, then update and re-build
your project, and you're done.</p>
<p>If there’s a package you want that isn't on this list, you'll need to
request a binary wheel. For Android, <a href="https://github.com/chaquo/chaquopy/issues">open a ticket on the Chaquopy
repository</a>. For iOS, <a href="https://github.com/freakboy3742/chaquopy">open a
ticket on this repository</a>. If
you're adventurous, you can also try building wheels yourself. The issue
trackers are on a project that has as "forge-like" tool for building
wheels, in the <span class="title-ref">server/pypi</span> folder; there
are tools and documentation describing how to build a package. The use
of these projects is a short-term measure; in the longer term, we want
to move to an actual “forge”-style community-managed model for managing
binary packages.</p>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>For the last few months, the focus of the BeeWare team has been on
Briefcase and the support packages. In October (and the rest of Q4),
we'll be shifting our focus to Toga. The initial focus will be on
improving the foundation of the project - testing and build
infrastructure; but once those pieces are in place, we'll start adding
new features.</p>
<p>We'll also be at <a href="https://2022.djangocon.us">DjangoCon US</a> in San
Diego - and there will be some web-related updates related to the
presentation that will be given at that conference. We hope we'll see
you there!</p>
<h2>Want to get involved?</h2>
<p>Want to get involved? Here's 10 open issues that would be a great place
to get started with contributing to a BeeWare project. They're all
relatively minor changes, but would provide a big improvement to the

  <h2><a href="/de_DE/news/buzz/august-2022-status-update/">August 2022 Status Update</a></h2>
  <p class="meta">
    Posted by
    
      <a href="https://cloudisland.nz/@freakboy3742">Russell Keith-Magee</a>
    
    on 1 September 2022 
  </p>
  
  <p>The main focus of the BeeWare team during August was binary module
support on mobile platforms. Although we haven't got the final results
of this work yet, we have significant progress to report for both iOS
and Android. We've also had a number of other improvements land over the
course of the month.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<p>During August:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have continued to work on the changes needed to migrate Android
support to Chaquopy. This has included some <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase-android-gradle-template/pull/52">major changes to the
Android Gradle
template</a>,
and developing a Rubicon Java compatibility layer. Eventually, Toga
will migrate to use the Chaquopy APIs directly, but in the interim,
the Rubicon APIs will continue to work.</li>
<li>We have started updating Chaquopy to support multiple Python versions.
Historically, Chaquopy has only supported a single Python3 version
(3.8); for compatibility with Briefcase, we are adding support for
Python 3.9 and 3.10, as well as preparing the ground for a 3.11
release when Python 3.11 is finalised.</li>
<li>We have modified the Python Apple support packages to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/Python-Apple-support/pull/161">provide the
binary portions of the Python standard library as dynamically loaded
binary
modules</a>,
and modified the
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase-iOS-Xcode-template/pull/7">iOS</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase-macOS-Xcode-template/pull/10">macOS</a>
templates to use and sign these binary modules. These changes haven't
landed yet, but they have been tested on simulators and physical
devices. Along the way, we've also updated the support packages to use
OpenSSL 3.</li>
<li>We have modified Briefcase to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/805">make the Python support package
optional</a>, at the
discretion of the project template. This was needed because Chaquopy
provides the Python library using a Gradle plugin, rather than
requiring a project to source a pre-compiled support package.</li>
<li>We have addressed an issue with the way Briefcase handles
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/816">requirements references when they are relative file
references</a>. Although
this was added to allow rapid debugging of changes to Toga on Android,
it also affected the recently added Linuxdeploy backend.</li>
<li>We've <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/846">added an "open" subcommand to
Briefcase</a>, making it
easier to open project-based templates in their respective IDEs.</li>
<li>We've <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/821">improved Android log
handling</a>, ensuring
that more app-specific logs are displayed to the user.</li>
<li>We've <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/844">dramatically improved our CI testing of
Briefcase</a>. We now
build an app on every platform we support, using every backend.</li>
<li>We've addressed a number of bugs in the Pack layout algorithm.</li>
<li>We've continued the process of making Toga widget APIs naming
internally consistent.</li>
<li>We've fixed some canvas bugs that were causing problems on Windowns
with our native Matplotlib rendering backend,
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga-chart">toga-chart</a>.</li>
<li>We've addressed some bugs associated with <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1572">changing the main content
of a Toga window</a>.</li>
<li>We added an <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1574">initial implementation of a DetailedList widget on
Windows</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>In September, we hope to wrap up the work on binary dependencies. On
Android, this is mostly a matter of completing the work to support
multiple Python versions. On iOS, we need to develop the tools to manage
the compilation of third-party binary libraries. We have an initial
proof of concept of this; we need to finish these tools, and develop the
infrastructure to distribute. We're also hoping to start conversations
with the Anaconda team about Conda integration with Briefcase, and start
improving GUI testing in Toga.</p>



  
  
  <h2><a href="/de_DE/news/buzz/july-2022-status-update/">July 2022 Status Update</a></h2>
  <p class="meta">
    Posted by

    on 1 August 2022 
  </p>
  
  <p>Another month of important updates to the BeeWare project! This month,
our focus was on packaging improvements on Linux and Windows.</p>
<p>In addition the technical progress, we welcomed <a href="https://github.com/mhsmith">Malcolm Smith (@mhsmith
on GitHub)</a> to the Anaconda BeeWare team!
Malcolm brings his considerable experience developing and maintaining
<a href="https://github.com/chaquo">Chaquopy</a>, a set of tools and libraries for
building Android applications that use Python. Chaquopy tackles the
"Python on Android" problem from the perspective of adding Python to an
existing Android Studio project rather than writing apps entirely with
Python; as a result, it features much tighter integration with native
Android Studio tooling. One particularly interesting feature of Chaquopy
is that it supports binary dependencies on Android - a key feature that
BeeWare's Android tooling currently lacks. Historically, Chaquopy was a
closed source tool with licenses available for open source projects;
however, as a result of joining Anaconda, Malcolm has <a href="https://chaquo.com/chaquopy/chaquopy-is-now-open-source/">released Chaquopy
as an Open Source
project</a>!</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<p>During July:</p>
<ul>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/756">added support for Linuxdeploy
plugins</a> for Linux
AppImages. These plugins are an important part of making AppImages
self-contained, as many libraries need to provide the Linuxdeploy
tooling hints to help find all the resources needed at runtime. Adding
support for these plugins should address most of the issues we've been
seeing with moving AppImages between Linux versions.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/802">added a Flatpak backend for Linux
packaging</a>. Flatpak is
an alternative packaging format to AppImage which has the support of a
number of large Linux distributions. For now, AppImage continues to be
the default Linux packaging format, but we may change this default in
the future.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/782">improved the packaging of Windows apps by adding a stub
binary</a>. We're still
hunting some bugs in this stub binary, but when those are resolved,
the Windows apps generated by Briefcase will present to the operating
system with consistent app naming and icons. The stub binary also
enables us to catch runtime problems with the app in a way that makes
diagnosing app problems much easier.</li>
<li>We presented a webinar about native application development. If you
weren't able to attend the webinar live, a recording is available;
<a href="https://event.on24.com/wcc/r/3766379/B50F020E006CF935D87609BF3E247ED7?partnerref=anaconda.com">register here to
watch</a>.</li>
<li>We got an initial proof of concept of a Toga app running on Android
using Chaquopy as a base, accessing a binary library (matplotlib),
deployed with Briefcase. Over the coming weeks, we're hoping this
proof of concept will evolve into major improvement to BeeWare's
Android tooling.</li>
<li>We modified Briefcase to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/777">use OS-appropriate directories for
caching</a>. While the
<code>~/.briefcase</code> location has served us well, it isn't a location that
adheres to platform-native conventions for storing app resources, so
we've moved Briefcase's cache of downloads, tools and templates to a
platform-appropriate location.</li>
<li>We addressed an issue with the <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/803">current working directory leaking into
the runtime path</a>. This
was especially common with Linux apps, but it could potentially be an
issue with other platforms as well.</li>
<li>We've started the process of making Toga widget APIs internally
consistent. While we've aimed to keep naming of widgets' attributes
and handlers consistent, there are a couple of annoying
inconsistencies. We've started the process of cleaning up these
inconsistencies.</li>
<li>We've started looking into binary dependencies on iOS apps.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>In August, our major focus will be binary dependencies on mobile. This
is one of the biggest missing pieces of the BeeWare story at present.
Being able to utilize Chaquopy as a base gives us a huge head start on
Android, so it seems likely we'll have a working solution for Android in
the near future. However, on iOS, we're still at the "we don't know what
we don't know" stage. It's unclear if we'll have a fully working
solution by the end of the month, but we should have at least some
progress to report.</p>



  
  
  <h2><a href="/de_DE/news/buzz/june-2022-status-update/">June 2022 Status Update</a></h2>

    on 4 July 2022 
  </p>
  
  <p>It's been another busy month at the hive! This month, we've had a couple
of high profile improvements, and some slow progress towards longer term
goals. These improvements have been primarily in Briefcase and app
packaging, but there have been some minor Toga improvements as well.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<p>During June:</p>
<ul>
<li>We significantly improved the UI of Briefcase by <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/740">adding
Rich</a> to implement
terminal output. This allows us to have <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/755">vastly improved progress
bars</a>, as well as the
ability to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/760">save a full debug log when a problem
occurs</a>. These
improvements (and several others) are the result of contributions from
community member <a href="https://github.com/rmartin16">Russell Martin</a> -
thanks Russell!</li>
<li>We added support for <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/757">macOS app
notarization</a>.</li>
<li>We improved the way the <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/766">Briefcase manages Android system
images</a>. This corrects
a bug we were seeing that was causing the Android emulator to be
installed twice, and could lead to situations where emulators could be
discovered, but not started.</li>
<li>We've explored the source of the <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/718">Linux packaging
problems</a> we've been
seeing. We've <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/761">documented a workaround for one of those
problems</a>; and we're
working on 2 fixes (<a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/756">supporting Linuxdeploy
plugins</a> and <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/754">adding
Flatpak support</a>) that
will hopefully address the remaining Linux packaging issues.</li>
<li>We've <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/775">improved Windows MSI
installers</a> so that it
will use the right <span class="title-ref">Program Files</span>
directory, as well as providing an install-time option for system vs
user installs of a package.</li>
<li>We made some small improvements that <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/769">improve support for non-ASCII
project names and
descriptions</a>.</li>
<li>We've made some <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1504">more improvements to Toga
Webviews</a>, ensuring that
the current URL is accessible through the Python API.</li>
<li>We've <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1514">addressed a long standing
bug</a> that would cause Toga
apps to be unable to find their local resource folders, depending on
how the app was invoked. More importantly, this change has been
accompanied by additions to the test suite. This is the start of being
able to test runtime behavior of apps, which will be an increasinging
important feature moving forward.</li>
<li>We've <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1513">added a stack trace dialog for
Windows</a>. A version of this
dialog will be integrated into future improvements in Windows
packaging.</li>
<li>Finally, we published our <a href="https://beeware.org/news/buzz/2022q3-roadmap/">Q3
roadmap</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>In July, we'll be focussing on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Completing the work on Linux and Windows application packaging.</li>
<li>Presenting a webinar about native application development. If you'd
like to attend, <a href="https://event.on24.com/wcc/r/3766379/B50F020E006CF935D87609BF3E247ED7?partnerref=anaconda.com">registration for this webinar is
open</a></li>
<li>Starting investigations into binary module support on mobile
platforms.</li>
</ul>
<p>We're also delighted to announce that we've successfully completed our
hiring process; so, in 2 weeks, there will be another Bee in the hive!
I'm very excited about the possibilities that this additional team
member will afford. Look out for a welcome announcement in the coming
weeks.</p>

    on 24 June 2022 
  </p>
  
  <p>One of the benefits of having the support of an organisation like
Anaconda is that we are now in a position to make more concrete
commitments on project goals, and the likely timeframe when key features
will be delivered. To that end, in addition to monthly status updates,
we're going to start publishing regular updates on our project roadmap
so the community has a better idea what to expect over the coming
months.</p>
<p>Project estimation is difficult at the best of times; and project
estimation on a FLOSS project is especially complex. In addition to any
work that we are planning internally as a team, we need to manage
contributions from the community. If a community member contributes a
piece of work that <em>isn't</em> on our roadmap, we need to review that work.
As a result, our ability to deliver on our own roadmap is dependent on
how much is contributed by the community - something that is very hard
to predict ahead of time.</p>
<p>In addition, several of the topics listed on this roadmap are complex,
foundational tasks, and potentially contain unknown complications. As
with any complex work, it can be difficult to predict ahead of time how
long that work will take.</p>
<p>As a result, this roadmap should be read as a guide to what we aim to
focus on over the coming quarter, rather than a hard commitment of
features that will be made available on a specific deadline.</p>
<h2>Q3 priorities</h2>
<p>During Q3, we're planning to work on:</p>
<h3>Linux packaging</h3>
<p>Breifcase's AppImage packaging backend has had <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/718">a cluster of issues
reported</a> related to
inclusion of third party libraries, and the post-processing that needs
to be performed on an AppImage. We've already started work on this
during Q2; early in Q3, you should expect to see this work wrapped up.
This will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding support for linuxdeploy plugins for our existing AppImage
backend; and</li>
<li>Adding a Flatpak backend.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Windows packaging</h3>
<p>Briefcase has an MSI packaging backend for Windows; and while this
backend works, it doesn't deliver an end-user experience that is as
polished as we'd like. We should be starting initial work on Windows
packaging in the coming week, with the complete solution completed in
early Q3. This will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding a stub binary for Windows apps, so that Briefcase apps present
to the task manager with the apps name and icon, rather than
"pythonw";</li>
<li>Improving log capture on Windows, so that it is easier to diagnose
when problems occur; and</li>
<li>Fixing some issues with the way the
<span class="title-ref">site</span> is defined and used. This may also
address some issues we've seen with binary modules in some Windows
apps.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Binary modules</h3>
<p>The biggest caveat on BeeWare's mobile app story has always been that we
don't provide support for binary packages on mobile platforms. In Q3,
we're going to start addressing this limitation.</p>
<p>There are already tools like
<a href="https://github.com/benfogle/crossenv">crossenv</a> that can simplify this
process, and we've got <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/647">a PR in our review
queue</a> that provides a
proof-of-concept implementation of Android binary packaging. We need to
take these tools, plus other tools in the Python ecosystem, and extend
Briefcase so that we can present a clear development story for mobile
developers that want to use modules with binary components.</p>
<p>On iOS, there is an additional complication - we need to resolve how to
manage dynamic loading of modules. BeeWare's iOS support currently
relies on static compilation of all binary modules. This was originally
done because prior to iOS8, dynamic linking was prohibited on iOS. The
days of iOS8 are now long behind us; but the Apple support package has
retained this old approach, mostly because it wasn't clear what approach
Apple would allow through the App Store review process. We will be
making changes to Briefcase's iOS support to accommodate dynamic module
loading, and then extending that support to include user-provided binary
modules.</p>
<h3>Testing (especially GUI testing)</h3>
<p>Without testing, it's very difficult to ensure the stability and
reliability of code in the long term. Unfortunately, many of the areas
where BeeWare operates are inherently difficult to test. Visual GUI
tests are notoriously difficult to perform; packaging tests require the
ability to actually install and run finished applications; testing
mobile applications requires access to mobile device hardware in a CI
setup. As a project, we've avoided writing tests for many of our core
features due to these complexities - and we've paid the price for this
in regressions. Now that we have more time, we can focus on setting up
the frameworks to let us perform this testing.</p>
<p>This includes adding:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Support package tests</strong>, ensuring that the packages include valid
libraries;</li>
<li><strong>App template tests</strong>, ensuring that Briefcase is able to generate
valid and installable applications; and</li>
<li><strong>GUI tests</strong>, ensuring that Toga generates apps that look and behave
the way they should.</li>
</ul>
<p>Testing is an ongoing process, so it's highly unlikely we'll have "100%
test coverage" by the end of the quarter. The goal will be to add the
frameworks that allow us to add tests <em>at all</em>, so that we can retrofit
tests onto existing code, and add tests on all new code going forward.
Ideally, these tests will be fully automated tests running in CI.
However, we may accept semi-automated or manual tests as a short term of
interim measure, especially if those tests lay the groundwork for fully
automated tests in the future.</p>
<h3>Conda integration</h3>
<p>Briefcase is currently uses PyPI and pip as source of Python packages.
However, PyPI and pip isn't the only packaging solution in the Python
ecosystem - another commonly used packaging source is Conda.</p>
<p>At this point, I must recognise the elephant in the room - Anaconda, the
company that produced and maintains Conda, is my employer. However, I
must stress that the fact this is on our roadmap is <em>not</em> as a result of
a directive from my employer. The original <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/596">proposal for this
idea</a> predates even my
earliest hiring discussions with Anaconda. It is being pursued now for
three reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>The key value of Conda is that it simplifies the process of
delivering complex binary packages, and ensuring that the binary
dependencies for those packages are isolated from any packages that
might be present on the user's computer. This core problem statement
shares a lot of similarities with the core problem associated with
application packaging. Conda also has much more nuanced
representation of hardware platforms, alternatives for binary
artefacts, and options for custom repositories. There is a
possibility that using Conda as a packaging base may simplify some
of the problems we've seen with distributing binary dependencies.</li>
<li>There is a significant portion of the Python community that have
commercial needs that requires the use of the managed repositories
provided by Anaconda, or are simply more familiar with Conda tooling
than PyPI/pip.</li>
<li>As a result of having 1 (soon to be 2) full time engineers, we now
have the resources to explore complex changes that might not have
otherwise been explored. We are exploring this idea because we now
have the resources to do so; we were not provided those resources on
the condition that we explore this idea.</li>
</ol>
<p>We don't anticipate dropping support for pip, or for PyPI as a package
source. We're looking at extending Briefcase to provide another commonly
used and requested option for packaging, rather than replacing PyPI/pip.</p>
<h2>Longer term goals</h2>
<p>Looking beyond Q3, the big items on the horizon are:</p>
<h3>Upstreaming</h3>
<p>The Apple and Android support packages maintained by BeeWare include a
number of patches against the core CPython. We want to begin the process
of getting these modifications into the CPython codebase.</p>
<p>There have been two major impediments to this in the past:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Development resources</strong> When we were a volunteer driven project,
we didn't have the resources to engage meaningfully with the CPython
core team to shepherd our patches into the CPython codebase.</li>
<li><strong>Testing</strong> Supported platforms in the CPython codebase need to have
CI solutions.</li>
</ol>
<p>We now have resources, so we can dedicate the time needed to upstream
patches; and once we've completed our testing work in Q3, we'll be in a
position to recommend CI configurations to the CPython core team. That
means the work of upstreaming patches and making iOS and Android fully
supported platforms can begin.</p>
<h3>Toga 1.0</h3>
<p>The broad goal for "Toga 1.0" could be considered "Tkinter, but with
some additional bells to show off". We want to deliver a core widget set
of the "essentials", plus some nice features to show off, like WebViews
and camera or GPS integration. The exact set of features for Toga 1.0 is
still a subject for discussion; I'd expect to see a more concrete
feature list and plan emerge in Q4.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>As with most of the work that has been done in Q2, the foundational work
we're planning for Q3 is not as glamorous as adding high profile GUI
widgets, but it's all necessary work if we're going to provide a stable
and reliable development story. Once this foundation is established,
we'll be in a much better position to rapidly develop new features that
<em>are</em> visible - and to ensure that those features are stable and
reliable as BeeWare develops.</p>



  
  
  <h2><a href="/de_DE/news/buzz/may-2022-status-update/">May 2022 Status Update</a></h2>
  <p class="meta">
    Posted by
    
      <a href="https://cloudisland.nz/@freakboy3742">Russell Keith-Magee</a>
    
    on 1 June 2022 
  </p>
  
  <p>It's been another busy month at the hive! The progress we made in May
isn't as obvious as last month - but the changes that have been made are
an essential part of ensuring we have a stable foundation for future
work on the BeeWare ecosystem.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<p>During May:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/beeware/Python-Apple-support/pull/145">We updated the Apple support
packages</a>.
These updates aren't <em>just</em> a version bump - they also added support
that enables the iOS emulator to run natively on M1 devices. This
required a major restructure of the way the support packages are
bundled, using Apple's new XCframework library packaging format.</li>
<li>We addressed an issue with the use of ctypes on physical iOS devices.
ctypes is a core part of the infrastructure we use to integrate with
the iOS system libraries, so resolving this bug was critical for
distributing apps. The fix was <a href="https://github.com/libffi/libffi/pull/718">deep in the core of
libFFI</a>, and has been
submitted for integration into the upstream project.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/beeware/Python-Android-support/pull/37">We released an Android support package for Python
3.10</a>, as
well as updated support packages for Python 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. These
support packages dramatically are now dramatically smaller, and result
in smaller end-user applications, thanks to some compiler flag
optimisations suggested by the community.</li>
<li>We began the process of adding support for Python 3.11 to the Apple
and Android support packages. This is the first time BeeWare has been
able to contribute prerelease testing to the CPython project. In the
process, we <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/92913">discovered a small backwards
incompatibility</a>.
Baring major incidents, we should be in a position to release
BeeWare's support for Python 3.11 on the same day as the official
3.11.0 is finalised.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/beeware/Python-support-testbed">We developed an acceptance test suite for the Apple and Android
support packages</a>.
This test suite tests for features in the Python core that have a
history of being broken (such as modules in the standard library that
have binary components, but have been incorrectly compiled or
inadvertently excluded from the build). This test suite isn't yet
formally integrated into the build process, but the hope is that it
will be in the near future.</li>
<li>We modified Briefcase so that it is able to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/719">run the Android emulator
on M1 hardware</a>. This
required a major rebuild of the way the Android SDK tooling is
managed.</li>
<li>We made further improvements to the log capture tools on macOS. This
ensures that <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/731">the first few seconds of application logs are reliably
captured</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/742">log
stream is terminated when the app
exits</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/744">We started the introduction of Black as a part of BeeWare's
development tooling</a>.
BeeWare's repositories have always enforced code style guidelines, and
those code styles are very closely aligned with Black's choices. With
Black formally moving out of Beta status at the start of this year,
the time has come to start adopting Black as a formal project
requirement. For now, Briefcase is the only project that has formally
adopted Black, but you can expect this to continue to roll out over
the other projects in BeeWare over the coming months.</li>
<li>We resolved some minor bugs that were present in the 0.3.0dev33
release of Toga. Most important of these was a bug that <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1492">prevented the
BeeWare tutorial running on iOS
devices</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of these changes either began as, or are entirely the work of
community members. There are also plenty of smaller PRs, bug fixes, and
bug reports that are just as important, but are too numerous to list. A
huge thanks to everyone who has contributed to BeeWare during May.</p>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>In June, we'll be focussing on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Publishing our roadmap for Q3 and beyond! Now that we have reliable
development resources, we're in a position to make public commitments
on the future direction of the project.</li>
<li>Completing the hiring process for another engineer to work on BeeWare
full time. This hiring process is underway, but it's not too late to
apply if you're interested. Full details of the position <a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/anaconda/jobs/4211521">can be found
on Greenhouse</a>.</li>
<li>App Notarization on macOS. This is becoming an increasingly required
part of macOS app publishing, as Apple cranks up their security
requirements.</li>
<li>Improving Windows packaging. This includes improving the way the
running app presents to the Task Manager, improving log capture, and
app signing.</li>
<li>Improving Linux packaging. This includes addressing some issues with
packaging binary dependencies.</li>
</ul>

  </p>
  
  <p>BeeWare is now hiring!</p>
<p>The position is a full time, Mid- to Senior position. You will be
working full time in the Open Source group at Anaconda, on the BeeWare
suite of tools. Full details of the position <a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/anaconda/jobs/4211521">can be found on
Greenhouse</a>.</p>
<p>The position calls for an unusual combination of skills. The ideal
candidate would have experience building GUI applications (especially
mobile) <em>and</em> Python skills. However, because of the existing state of
the Python ecosystem, most Python developers don't have GUI development
experience, and most GUI developers don't have extensive Python
experience. For that reason, if the position is interesting to you, but
you don't have all the "must have" attributes - <em>I would encourage you
to apply anyway</em>. A candidate with no GUI development experience will
still considered, as long as they've got a demonstrated history of doing
weird and wonderful things with Python. Similarly, a developer with deep
GUI experience, but no Python experience, will also be considered.</p>
<p>The job location requirements are also unusual. The position is remote;
the position requires that your working hours need to be compatible with
UTC+8. This means candidates from Australia, South East and South Asia
will be a natural fit. European candidates will need to be prepared for
early morning starts. US/Canadian candidates will need to be prepared
for evening work (<em>very</em> late evenings if you're in CST or EST
timezones). Anaconda has the capacity to hire in the UK, Germany, India,
Australia, US, and Canada. If you're <em>not</em> a resident of one of those
countries, it <em>may</em> be possible to hire you, but it will likely require
you to operate as a private contractor rather than a salaried employee.</p>
<p>I'm incredibly excited for what the future holds for BeeWare - if you'd
like to come on this journey with me, <a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/anaconda/jobs/4211521">please
apply</a> (and tell
them Russell sent you)!</p>

  </p>
  
  <p>One of the benefits of <a href="/de_DE/news/buzz/exciting-news-for-the-future-of-beeware">having the support of an organization like
Anaconda</a> is that we now
have the time to perform little housekeeping tasks like publishing
community updates. As a result, this is the first (of hopefully many)
monthly updates letting you know what progress has been made in the
BeeWare suite.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<p>During April:</p>
<ul>
<li>We've cleared the backlog of pull requests and issue triage. At this
point, the only PRs that are open are ones that require updates or
changes from the submitters. A lot of stale or duplicated issues have
also been closed or consolidated.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1448">Webviews on Windows now use the EdgeChromium renderer, rather than
the IE11 renderer</a>. This
massively improves the HTML compatibility of web views on Windows.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1461">Toga windows now use a "single source of truth"
approach</a>, using the API
calls of the underlying GUI platform to determine the title, position
and size of a window. This, in turn, allowed for the implementation of
APIs that allow you to set the title, position and size of windows on
desktop platforms.</li>
<li><code>on_exit</code> handlers on an App <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1463">can now be asynchronous
co-routines</a></li>
<li>Toga dialogs that return a result (such as YesNoDialog) now <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1464">use an
asynchronous API</a>. This is
a backwards incompatible change that was required to support dialogs
on Android; it also allows us to remove a nasty hack that was needed
on iOS. However, we've been able to implement this in such a way that
any existing usage that is incompatible with the new required usage
will be flagged with a helpful error.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1470">GTK web view has been
improved</a>, correcting some
odd caching behaviour.</li>
<li>Following the <a href="https://pyscript.net">announcement of PyScript at PyCon US
2022</a>, we've been able to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1475">resurrect the Web
backend for Toga</a>. This is
still in the very early stages - but it's sufficiently advanced that
we can run the first 2 tutorials, in both a "server side rendering"
and "single page app" format.</li>
<li>We've <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/690">improved Briefcase's code signing integration on
macOS</a>. This should
prevent some errors we've seen when signing apps that contain
third-party binary modules</li>
<li>We've significantly improved validation and error handling when an app
name contains <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/698">non-Latin
characters</a> ,
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/697">punctuation</a>, or
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/617">reserved words</a>.</li>
<li>We've added CI checks to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/700">ensure that Briefcase is always able to
generate a valid signed app
bundles</a></li>
<li>We've <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/704">improved the output generated by verbose debug
output</a> to improve full
environment details . This should make it easier to identify why a
command is failing due to unexpected user environments, and to assist
in manually reproducing Briefcase's behaviour outside Briefcase.</li>
<li>We now ensure that <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/714">macOS apps are *always*
signed</a>. This is needed
because <em>all</em> apps required at least ad-hoc signing to execute on M1
hardware.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of these PRs either began as, or are entirely the work of community
members. There are also dozens of smaller PRs, bug fixes, and bug
reports that are just as important, but are too numerous to list in a
post like this. A huge thanks to everyone who has contributed to BeeWare
during April.</p>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>In May, we'll be focussing on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updating the support packages for macOS and iOS apps. Apple's
transition to M1 hardware means there are new simulator architectures
that require support; this, in turn, requires that we adopt Xcode's
new XCFramework for the packaging libraries, which requires some
fairly major changes to the way the support packages are built.</li>
<li>Updating the support packages on Android to support Python 3.10.</li>
<li>Notarization on M1. This is becoming an increasingly required part of
macOS app publishing, as Apple cranks up the security requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>We're also expecting to start the hiring process in the coming month.
We'll provide more details when we can point a full job description. If
you think you'd like to make BeeWare your day job (or you know someone
who might), now would be a good time to start polishing your resume.</p>

    on 6 April 2022 
  </p>
  
  <p>The biggest challenge for any Open Source project is finding the
resources needed to support development - and the BeeWare project is no
exception.</p>
<p>To date, BeeWare has been primarily driven by the efforts of volunteers.
We've been able to achieve amazing things with those volunteer efforts,
demonstrating that Python is a viable language for GUI development on
macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS and Android, as well as providing a
proof-of-concept demonstration on Web. However, there are still lots of
features that we'd like to add, and lots of ongoing maintenance that
needs to be done as operating systems and hardware platforms evolve.</p>
<p>Over the years, we've been incredibly fortunate to have the financial
support of our members. While I'm incredibly grateful for that support,
it falls a long way short of even one full-time salary. We've also
received grants (such as the PSF grant), and short-term contracts. These
grants and contracts have enabled us to add specific (and much needed)
features to BeeWare - but they don't provide resources for ongoing
development and maintenance.</p>
<p>However, the brutal truth is that our rate of progress is severely
limited by the volunteered resources at our disposal. As a result, I've
spent a lot of time over the last few years thinking about how we can
fund the work that needs to be done to make BeeWare the go-to solution
for GUI development on desktop, mobile, and more - and do so without
compromising the Open Source roots of the project.</p>
<p>I'm incredibly excited to announce that I've found a solution.</p>
<p>On March 21, I joined Anaconda as a Principal Engineer and Team Lead -
and the team I will be leading will be focused 100% on BeeWare.</p>
<p>Anaconda is no stranger to Open Source. In addition to indirectly
funding a number of community efforts through their Anaconda Dividend
program, they directly employ people to work on Numba, Dask, Pyston and
more. BeeWare will be joining this stable of projects.</p>
<p>Anaconda is supporting BeeWare in this way because they see the
potential for Python as a language for GUI development - especially on
mobile platforms. Python has established itself as an incredibly popular
language in education, science, business and more - and in all those
markets, there is potential to develop apps. By adding mobile platform
support and app development to the list of tasks to which Python is
already incredibly capable, Anaconda hopes to ensure the long term
prospects of Python as a language, as well as ensuring a healthy market
for the products they sell commercially.</p>
<p>BeeWare will continue to be a 100% Open Source project, with all
contributions welcome from the community. The only difference is that
Anaconda will be directly employing some of the contributors to the
project. The conversations I've had with Anaconda's engineering
leadership indicates they are acutely aware of the tension that exists
between corporate funding and the technical direction of an Open Source
project. They've indicated that they want to ensure that BeeWare's
technical direction remains independent in both appearance and
substance. This includes financial independence - the financial support
provided by our members will remain vitally important, as it provides
project-level funding for resources such as hosting and promotional
materials.</p>
<p>The related good news is that part of my job title is "Team Lead" - so
in the very near future, we'll be looking for people to join me on my
team. I'm already working out the details of the team that I'd like to
have, so watch this space for hiring announcements.</p>
<p>Anaconda has a long history of understanding and contributing to both
the Python ecosystem and the Open Source community. Adding BeeWare to
their stable of supported projects has enormous potential for BeeWare,
and the Python ecosystem as a whole. I'm incredibly excited for what the
future holds.</p>

  <p>Today, the BeeWare project is making 2 changes to the way we organize
our community.</p>
<p>Firstly, we're going to <strong>move our real-time chat community from Gitter
to Discord</strong>.</p>
<p>When we originally set up Gitter, it was a strong option for a chat
community - especially one that was focussed on a software project, due
to its tight integration with GitHub. However, over the years, Gitter
has undergone multiple changes of ownership, but has remained
essentially unchanged - in some cases, it's gotten appreciably worse
(their native iOS and Android clients are effectively deprecated). In
the meantime, Discord has emerged as a dominant player for community
chat. It has a robust mobile client, and really good tools for community
moderation, as well as the option of hosting video and voice chats -
something we hope to be able to use for coordinating virtual sprints.</p>

<p>Secondly, we're going to <strong>start using GitHub Discussions</strong>.</p>
<p>For many years, we've tried to use GitHub Issues as a pseudo-forum.
There's a lot of similarity between how a forum works and how GitHub
displays and manages issues. Each "issue" is effectively a forum thread,
and each comment is a message in that thread. However, there are also
some important differences. Issues get closed when they're resolved;
forum threads, however, don't necessarily have a resolution. Most
importantly, "closing" an issue can look like someone is trying to kill
discussion - when all they're really trying to do is keep the list of
issues manageable.</p>
<p>The good news is that GitHub has noticed the similarity too, and has
launched GitHub Discussions. Discussions offers a familiar "forum"
interface, but with the familiar GitHub message interface, and tight
integration with GitHub Issues and pull requests.</p>
<p>We've enabled Discussions on all the key BeeWare projects -
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/discussions">Toga</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/discussions">Briefcase</a>, <a href="https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/discussions">Rubicon
ObjC</a>, <a href="https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-java/discussions">Rubicon
Java</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/colosseum/discussions">Colosseum</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/travertino/discussions">Travertino</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/podium/discussions">Podium</a>.</p>
<p>Naturally, all of these new community spaces - along with all existing
BeeWare spaces - are subject to the <a href="/community/behavior/">BeeWare Community Code of
Conduct</a>.</p>
<p>We hope these two changes will make it easier to participate in the
BeeWare community. See you there!</p>
