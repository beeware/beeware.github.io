  <p>In June, BeeWare made a lot of progress, landing lots of new features - many of which have been the subject of requests and discussions for a long time.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-we-ve-done">
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1781">added support for packaging console apps to Briefcase</a>. This involved adding a new <tt class="docutils literal">.pkg</tt> packaging type for macOS, as well as a number of other improvements to the stub app and MSI packaging on Windows. In addition to providing a way to package console apps on macOS, the addition of <tt class="docutils literal">.pkg</tt> format means it is now possible to distribute apps using centralised device management tooling (such as Kandji or FleetDM).</li>
<li>We modified Briefcase to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1849">distribute the stub binaries as standalone artefacts, rather than including them in the app template</a>. We also <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1855">significantly optimised how Briefcase uses templates</a>. Between these two changes, the download size required for a first project on macOS has been reduced from around 200MB, to less than 4MB.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1864">isolated Briefcase's use of Cookiecutter</a> so that all of Briefcase's cached content is contained in Briefcase's own cache folder.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1856">added support for distribution certificates on macOS</a>.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2585">modified Toga's APIs to use namedtuple types for Size and Position references</a>.</li>
<li>We corrected a number of stability issues with Toga's testbed CI, and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2670">added CI testing for Wayland on Linux</a>.</li>
<li>We completed a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2252">major overhaul of typing in Toga's API surface</a>.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2642">added support for conditional coverage in Toga's testing</a>. It is now possible to get a clean coverage report without running the test suite on every Python version and every platform.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2636">added an official API for customizing the system-installed menu items</a>.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1930">added an API for detecting the screens available for an app to use, and for setting the position of windows relative to those screens</a>.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2649">added support for &quot;simple&quot; apps</a> - apps that don't have menu bars.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2651">added support for apps whose lifecycle isn't tied to a single &quot;Main&quot; window</a>, such as background apps (apps that don't have any windows) and document-based apps.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2669">added support for app modal dialogs</a>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-s-next">
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>Work on Toga's App interface isn't quite finished - we're expecting to finalise the Document API in the near future. Once that work is complete, our focus will be the mobile Python binary packaging ecosystem. The work we've done so far this year has led to CPython 3.13 formally supporting iOS and Android as Tier 3 supported platforms; the next step is ensuring that the rest of the community can build iOS and Android packages. This will involve improvements to tools like <tt class="docutils literal">pip</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">cibuildwheel</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">meson-python</span></tt> and more. We expect that this work will take most of the rest of the quarter to release; but there should be some initial signs of progress by the end of the month.</p>

  <p>BeeWare activity in May was dominated by preparing for and attending PyCon US in Pittsburgh. That event generated a lot of activity in the BeeWare project - but we've also added some other significant improvements.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-we-ve-done">
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>We attended PyCon US. We presented on the <a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2024/events/language-summit/">state of mobile support in CPython to the Language Summit</a>; we <a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2024/schedule/presentation/41/">presented a tutorial</a> to over 30 attendees; we ran a booth in Community Row; we <a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2024/schedule/presentation/40/">presented a talk</a> on writing a data visualisation app with BeeWare tools; and we ran an extremely successful sprint. At the peak, we had over 30 people sprinting on BeeWare projects; and we handed out over 20 challenge coins to first time contributors. Many of the new features in this status update can be attributed to contributions from sprint participants.</li>
<li>We modified Toga's Window API to allow <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2314">setting the content of the window when the window is constructed</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2591">improved the APIs for replacing children in an existing window layout</a>.</li>
<li>We modified how validation of TextInput widgets are handled so that <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2596">change handlers aren't invoked until validation has been performed</a>.</li>
<li>We modified how the DetailedList is created on Android so that <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2595">the dependency on the native SwipeRefreshLayout widget only exists if your app actually uses a DetailedList widget</a>.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2590">improved the error handling around camera permissions on macOS</a>, and ensured that <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1820">Briefcase will generate the right permissions for macOS Sonoma</a>.</li>
<li>We diagnosed some issues associated with code signing on macOS <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1808">when running on iCloud-mirrored drives</a>, and when <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1831">Git has been configured to preserve Windows newlines</a>. We also <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1825">improved the error handling when notarisation fails</a>.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1807">formally documented the plugin extension points that Briefcase provides</a>. With this formally documented interface, Pygame-CE and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1834">PPB</a>, have taken formal ownership of their Briefcase bootstraps.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1812">formally adopted PEP 621 format for specifying license files in Briefcase</a>.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1824">loosened the restrictions on bundle identifiers</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1811">improved handling of applications with special characters in their formal names</a>.</li>
<li>We developed a draft implementation of a change that will <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1781">allow Briefcase to package console applications</a>. We expect this change will land in the next week or so, and be released soon after that.</li>
<li>We started work on <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1849">removing binary stubs from the macOS and Windows app templates</a>. This was starting to become a significant performance issue for first-time Briefcase users.</li>
<li>We improved the mechanism for invoking methods in Rubicon ObjC, making it possible to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/pull/462">invoke methods with repeated argument names</a>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-s-next">
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>In June, we're expecting to see progress in three main areas.</p>
<p>Firstly, we'll be finalising the work on packaging console applications. We expect to see a Briefcase release by mid month that will incorporate this, and all the other improvements that have landed over the last month.</p>
<p>Secondly, we'll be working on the APIs for the Toga App and Window classes. We've already done <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2244">a lot of prototyping work in this area</a>; once this work is complete, Toga should have support for apps without a menubar in their main window, support for status bar apps without a main window, vastly improved abilities to customise standard menu items, and a stable API for document-based apps.</p>
<p>Thirdly, we'll start looking at the broader CPython binary packaging ecosystem. The work we've done so far this year has led to CPython 3.13 formally supporting iOS and Android as Tier 3 supported platforms; the next step is ensuring that the rest of the community can build iOS and Android packages. This will involve improvements to tools like <tt class="docutils literal">pip</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">cibuildwheel</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">meson-python</span></tt> and more. We expect that this work will take much longer than a month to complete, but we hope to be able to share some progress in June.</p>

  <p>This month has seen BeeWare reach one major milestone, almost reach a second, as well as landing several smaller improvements.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-we-ve-done">
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>iOS is <a class="reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0011/#tier-3">officially a Tier 3 supported platform for CPython</a>! All the patches needed to support iOS have been merged, and a <a class="reference external" href="https://buildbot.python.org/all/#/builders/1380">buildbot has been deployed</a> to verify that CPython can run on iOS. As a result, <a class="reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0730/">PEP 730 has been moved into &quot;Final&quot; status</a>.</li>
<li>Android support in CPython is getting very close to completion. The last three patches (adding a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/117878">test harness for running the test suite on Android</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/118063">redirecting stdout and stderr to the Android log</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/118352">updating sysconfig to support Android</a>) are currently in review; once those have been merged, and a buildbot has been deployed, Android should also be at Tier 3 status.</li>
<li>We landed a new <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2462">Geolocation service for Toga</a>, providing access to GPS data on mobile devices and macOS.</li>
<li>We made some <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2527">modifications to how Toga handles application icons</a>, removing the need to duplicate the icon in application data. These changes are in final review.</li>
<li>We added a new wizard to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1231">add a Briefcase configuration to an existing Python project</a>.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1751">modified how Briefcase handles splash screens on mobile devices</a>, and corrected some issues with icons seen on recent Android releases.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/pull/446">corrected a problem in Rubicon ObjC</a> caused by a change to the <tt class="docutils literal">ctypes</tt> module in CPython 3.13. It might be possible to upstream this fix to CPython itself; but for now, Rubicon ObjC is able to support Python 3.13.0a6.</li>
<li>We drafted a new tutorial step about <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/beeware/pull/327">customising application appearance</a>. This update is in review, and should be live in the near future.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-s-next">
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>The bulk of May will be taken up by preparing for and attending PyCon US. We're presenting a <a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2024/schedule/presentation/40/">talk</a> and a <a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2024/schedule/presentation/41/">tutorial</a>; we're also <a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2024/events/language-summit/">presenting at the Language Summit</a>, we will have a booth in the community section of the Expo Hall, and we'll be there for the first 3 days of the sprints. If you're coming to Pittsburgh and you'd like to attend that tutorial session, <a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2024/attend/information/">ticket sales are open!</a>.

  </p>
  
  <p>Q1 2024 has seen some major progress - but as always, there's still plenty of work to do. As always, this roadmap should be read as a guide to what we aim to focus on over the coming quarter, rather than a hard commitment of features that will be made available on a specific deadline.</p>
<div class="section" id="q1-progress">
<h2>Q1 progress</h2>
<p>The first quarter of 2024 has seen significant progress towards getting iOS and Android to Tier 3 supported status in CPython. <a class="reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0738/">PEP 738</a> has been formally accepted by the CPython steering committee, and the vast majority of the changes needed to support  <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/114099">iOS</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/116622">Android</a> have either been merged, or received substantial review from the CPython core team.</p>
<p>We've also made progress on a number of long standing feature requests in Toga. We've added an OptionContainer for Android, so tab-based UIs can be used on all platforms. We've added a MapView widget that works on all desktop and mobile platforms. We've also added the start of hardware APIs, including Camera and Geolocation APIs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="q2-priorities">
<h2>Q2 priorities</h2>
<p>Our Q2 goals are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Get iOS and Android to Tier 3 supported status</strong>. We expect to finish upstreaming the patches we have for CPython early in the quarter. However, Tier 3 status also requires CI infrastructure to verify that the platforms are stable. In Q2, we will commission buildbots so that CPython's CI is able to verify the ongoing stability of iOS and Android as a platform.</li>
<li><strong>Extend the BeeWare tutorial</strong>. The BeeWare tutorial provides a good introduction to using Briefcase and Toga, but there are a number of common support questions that aren't covered by the tutorial, and some features that we've added since the tutorial last saw significant edits. We're going to revisit the tutorial, adding some extra steps to cover these new features and common issues.</li>
<li><strong>Attend PyCon US 2024</strong> We're presenting a tutorial and a talk; we will have a booth in the community section; we'll be there for the full duration of the sprints; and we're also expecting to attend the language summit. It's going to be a busy 2 weeks - we hope we see you there!</li>
<li><strong>Start working on packaging for mobile platforms</strong>. PEP 730 and PEP 738 cover the core of CPython itself, but Python is much more than just the core interpreter and standard library. There's also the ecosystem of third-party libraries, many of which have binary components. In this quarter, we're going to start looking at the changes that are needed to make it easy for the community to start packaging wheels for iOS and Android.</li>
<li><strong>Modify the App class to support other types of apps</strong>. This includes adding an API for a &quot;Simple App&quot; that doesn't have a menu bar, finalising the API for document-based apps, and providing an API for system tray apps.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="longer-term-goals">
<h2>Longer term goals</h2>
<p>Completing PEP 730 and 738 is a major milestone - but there's still a lot of work to be done. It will take a lot of time and community education before iOS and Android binary packages are widely available. We intend to do whatever we can to support the community, ranging from documentation, to tooling support, to submitting patches to upstream packages.</p>
<p>One of the ways to accelerate this transition will be to make iOS and Android compelling platforms to support. This means adding more capabilities to Toga, so that there aren't any capability gaps for a user writing an app. It also means writing more documentation and tutorials so that common app development tasks are well explained.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This month marks 2 years since full-time work began on BeeWare; and 10 years since the first commits on the project. We've come a long way in that time - from a collection of cobbled-together proof of concept demonstrators to a fully tested GUI platform, with equally tested deployment tooling, and official support in CPython itself. The future for Python as a GUI development platform on desktop and mobile has never looked better, and we're excited to see what the coming years will bring.</p>

  <p>This month, we have less to report by raw feature count - but the changes we <em>have</em> made represent extremely significant progress.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-we-ve-done">
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Our primary focus this month has been making the changes to CPython needed to add support for <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/114099">iOS</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/116622">Android</a>. We've made major progress towards this goal: all the patches required for iOS have been merged; a large number of patches have been submitted for Android, with only a small number still required. This month, we have:<ul>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/115918">Added test exclusions to support running the test suite on Android</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/115955">Fixed some issues with the process of building an Android libPython</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/116215">Modified sys.platform identification for Android so it returns &quot;android&quot; not &quot;linux&quot;</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/116674">Added an API to get device and OS information on Android</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/116379">Modified ctypes so it can load libraries on Android</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/116423">Modified a signals test to make it more reliable on more platforms</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/116426">Added a build script and instructions for Android builds</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/116454">Added a custom module loader so that iOS apps can load binary modules from Frameworks</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/116758">Modified test_doctest to support platforms that don't support subprocesses</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/117052">Modified the standard library to support iOS</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/117057">Added documentation for the iOS platform</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/117299">Corrected some additional test failures introduced on Android</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0738/">PEP 738</a>, adding official Android support to CPython, has been formally approved by the Python Steering Council.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/devguide/pull/1296">updated the CPython Developer Guide to describe the iOS development process</a>.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1687">improved Briefcase's handling of stdout for some tools</a>. We're hoping this will fix - or at least make it easier to diagnose - a mode of failure we've had reported for the Android emulator on Windows.</li>
<li>We added <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1676">color to Android's log output</a>.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2415">corrected the handling of key shortcuts on Window and GTK</a>, adding a lot of key combinations that weren't previously possible to represent.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2463">restructured the Toga documentation landing page</a>, making it easier to find the documentation you're likely to need.</li>
<li>We landed the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2379">MapView widget</a>, and have completed most of the work on a new <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2462">Geolocation service</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>In April, we're hoping to wrap up the work on iOS and Android patches for CPython, and add buildbots for those platforms. With the buildbots in place, iOS and Android will officially be Tier 3 supported CPython platforms. We also plan to revisit the BeeWare tutorial, adding some more steps in preparation for a <a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2024/schedule/presentation/41/">tutorial presentation at PyCon US</a> in May.

<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0738/">PEP 738</a>, adding official Android support to CPython, has been formally submitted to the Python Steering Council for approval.</li>
<li>We've started landing patches in CPython to add formal support for <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/114099">iOS</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/71052">Android</a>. There are more patches in review, and more to come, but so far we've landed patches that:<ul>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/114876">Fix the compilation of the grp module on Android</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/114889">Disable tests that can't run on mobile platforms</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/115120">Refactor the CPython build system to allow for some of the oddities of iOS as a platform</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/115390">Add build targets for compiling iOS-compatible frameworks</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/115780">Correct the linking of extension modules on Android</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/115917">Enable the concurrent.futures tests on platforms that don't support multiprocessing</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We added macOS ARM64 machines to our CI capabilities for <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2404">Toga</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1652">Briefcase</a>. We've officially supported ARM64 on macOS for some time, but we've been unable to test this support as part of our CI and release procedure - we've had to do ad-hoc testing on the machines we're using to develop on a day to day basis. As a result of improvements to Github's CI infrastructure, we're now able to perform automated testing. As part of these changes, we've also added testing for Python 3.13 (which will be released around October of this year).</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1930">added an API for detecting the displays attached to a computer, and specifying the location of windows relative to those displays</a>.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2387">added a pluggable API for image formats</a>. With this API, any third party library that has an internal format for images can implement support so that Toga can convert to and from images in that format.</li>
<li>We've significantly improved shortcut key handling on GTK and Winforms, including <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2415">improved coverage of non-alphanumeric keys</a>, and support for <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2232">numpad keys</a>.</li>
<li>We've <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2379">added a MapView widget</a>. This widget is in final review, but should land very soon.</li>
<li>We've improved error handling when the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1630">Android emulator fails to start</a>. This should hopefully make it easier to identify the source of any emulator failures.</li>
<li>We've added the ability to run <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1603">Linux apps that have been built for different platforms</a>. Using Docker, it's now possible to run a Fedora system app on an Ubuntu machine, or any other combination of supported platforms.</li>
<li>We've added the ability to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1661">pass extra arguments to Docker when building images</a>.</li>
<li>We've <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1649">improved the console output for non-interactive consoles</a> on some long-running commands.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-s-next">
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>In March, we will continue to focus on iOS and Android patches for CPython; if all goes extremely well, the bulk of patches should be upstream (or at least submitted for review) by the end of the month. While we're waiting for CPython patches to be reviewed, we'll be adding geolocation APIs to Toga.</p>

  <p>January has seen some long awaited and high profile features added to BeeWare.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-we-ve-done">
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0738/">PEP 738</a>, formalizing the introduction of Android as a Tier 3 platform in CPython, has been formally accepted as a draft. We're now revising the draft following community feedback, in anticipation of submitting the PEP for formal approval in the near future.</li>
<li>We added a cross-platform Camera API to Toga. This API has been <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2266">implemented for iOS and macOS</a>; the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2353">implementation for Android</a> is in final review.</li>
<li>We added an <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2350">OptionContainer widget for Android</a>. This now means that OptionContainer is available on every desktop and mobile platform.</li>
<li>We added the ability to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2310">define a button with an Icon</a>. In addition, we've added some <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2348">major clarifications to the documentation about the difference between an Icon and an Image</a>.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2320">reworked the way that widget IDs are handled</a>. This change was required due to a bug caused by the interaction of Python's garbage collector and the widget registry that prevented the re-use of widget IDs in some situations. The new implementation means that the widget registry behaves a lot more like a browser's DOM - a widget can only be discovered by ID when it is actually part of a widget layout.</li>
<li>We added Briefcase support for <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1596">Python 3.12 on Android</a>.</li>
<li>We added a mechanism for <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1599">defining app permissions</a> in your Briefcase project.</li>

  </p>
  
  <p>It's the start of a new year, which means it's time to cast our minds forward to what BeeWare will bring in the coming year. 2023 saw some major milestones in stability and features; in 2024, we're going to build on that foundation. As always, this roadmap should be read as a guide to what we aim to focus on over the coming quarter, rather than a hard commitment of features that will be made available on a specific deadline.</p>
<div class="section" id="q4-progress">
<h2>Q4 progress</h2>
<p>During the last quarter of 2024, we finally finished our audit and testing of Toga. We now have 100% branch coverage on every line of Toga's core, and on the macOS, Windows, GTK, Android and iOS backends. We published <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/toga/0.4.0/">Toga 0.4</a>, incorporating all these changes - but it also meant that we were able to start adding <em>new</em> features to Toga, including an OptionContainer widget on iOS, and a draft of a Camera API for iOS and macOS. Toga's new test framework has made adding these new features must easier - for example, we were able to very rapidly identify (and resolve) gaps in functionality in the new iOS OptionContainer widget by running the existing test suite on a new implementation. We expect that this testing foundation will continue to serve us well as we add more features in the coming year.</p>
<p>The other major development for the quarter was the start of the upstreaming process for Python on mobile platforms. <a class="reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0730/">PEP730</a>, proposing the addition of iOS to the Tier 3 supported list of CPython core, has been ratified by the steering council; and <a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-738-adding-android-as-a-supported-platform/40975">PEP738</a>, proposing the same for Android, is in draft form. The first patch contributing towards iOS support has already landed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="q1-priorities">
<h2>Q1 priorities</h2>
<p>Our Q1 goals are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Complete upstreaming iOS and Android support patches to CPython core</strong>. We will finalise PEP738 and submit it for ratification; and we'll continue upstreaming the iOS and Android patches that we've been maintaining independently. This work has a hard deadline of May 7, as that is when Python 3.13.0b1 is planned, which is the feature cutoff for Python 3.13 development, so making sure we hit that deadline will be our main priority.</li>
<li><strong>Add OptionContainer for Android</strong>. The implementation on iOS was relatively straightforward; we have no reason to believe that the Android implementation will be any more complicated.</li>
<li><strong>Complete the implementation of the Camera API</strong>. We have a draft PR implementing a Camera API on macOS and iOS; we'll extend this API to Android, and complete the work on Briefcase that is needed to add support for permissions.</li>
<li><strong>Add an API for geolocation, and a Map widget</strong>. Geolocation is another major hardware features that is common on phones; we need to write a cross-platform layer for that hardware, plus add a native mapping widget to show off this capability.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="longer-term-goals">
<h2>Longer term goals</h2>
<p>For the remainder of this year, you can expect to see three major themes in BeeWare development.</p>
<p>Firstly, we're going to continue to work upstreaming the work BeeWare has done in the mobile space into the wider CPython community. Once iOS and Android have been incorporated into CPython core, the focus will move to the packaging ecosystem. This means adding official support to upload iOS and Android packages to PyPI, and making it easy for third party projects to incorporate iOS and Android builds into their release processes.</p>
<p>Secondly, we'll be increasing our efforts in education and training. BeeWare has a tutorial that we're extremely proud of - but there are many things we could add to that tutorial, and there are plenty of &quot;How To&quot; and topic guides that could be written for those who have finished the tutorial and want to try more advanced ideas.</p>
<p>Thirdly, we'll continue to expand the capabilities of Toga. There are a handful of high profile widgets and capabilities that have been patiently waiting for us to have a stable platform to build on, and the spare capacity to implement them - features like a Radio Button widget, Trees and Tables on mobile platforms, a cross-platform Settings API, and cross-platform cloud file access.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>2024 promises to be a very exciting year for BeeWare. For the last 2 years, we've been focused on consolidating and stabilizing existing features. That work is coming to a close, which will allow us to turn our attention to building new features that show off the stable foundation we've built, and to providing the resources that will allow more users to try BeeWare for themselves.</p>

  <p>December has been a short month due to end-of-year holidays, but BeeWare has still made some important progress.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-we-ve-done">
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0730/">PEP730</a>, formalizing the introduction of iOS as a Tier 3 platform in CPython, has been <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/steering-council/issues/218#issuecomment-1839333665">ratified by the CPython Steering Council</a>.</li>
<li>The <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/112738">first patch to CPython that explicitly mentions iOS</a> has been merged. This is a relatively minor change that is required for building cross-platform binary modules; we'll start submitting more substantial patches in the new year.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0738/">PEP738</a>, formalizing the introduction of Android as a Tier 3 platform in CPython, has been drafted, and is <a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-738-adding-android-as-a-supported-platform/40975">currently under discussion</a>.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://chaquo.com/chaquopy/chaquopy-version-15-0-1/">Chaquopy 15 was released</a>, adding support for Python 3.12 on Android. This release also improves compatibility with Android Studio's transition away from Groovy, towards Kotlin for configuration.</li>
<li>An <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2259">implementation of OptionContainer was added for iOS</a>.</li>
<li>A number of improvements were made to image handling, including <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2263">optimizations when creating images from internal APIs</a>, and a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2276">correction to flexible image resizing behavior</a>.</li>
<li>A <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2291">long standing bug that would cause macOS tables to crash</a> was resolved.</li>
<li>The <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2260">ability to define platform-specific icons</a> was added to Toga.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/toga/0.4.1/">Toga 0.4.1 was released</a>, incorporating the features and bug fixes from the last 2 months.</li>
<li>Work has begun on a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2266">cross-platform Camera API</a> . This currently works on iOS, with a draft implementation on macOS. Before this work can land, we need to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/547">add support in Briefcase for declaring permissions</a>; a design for this has been proposed, and will be implemented early in the new year.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-s-next">
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>When we return from the end-of-year break, we'll be back into developing Toga. In the near future, you should see an OptionContainer on Android, and permission support in Briefcase; once that work is wrapped, we'll start looking at more more hardware APIs and missing widgets. You should also start to see more patches land in CPython to support iOS, and the finalisation of <a class="reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0738/">PEP 738</a>.</p>

  </p>
  
  <p>November has been a month of focus on the code that enables us to run Python on iOS and Android - but there has still been some other high profile developments in other parts of BeeWare.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-we-ve-done">
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0730/">PEP730</a>, formalizing the introduction of iOS as a Tier 3 platform in CPython, has been <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/steering-council/issues/218">submitted to the Python Steering Council for ratification</a>.</li>
<li>One of the major topics covered by the <a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-730-adding-ios-as-a-supported-platform/35854">discussion about PEP730</a> was the use of a deprecated compiler argument. This led to some re-examination of how CPython could be delivered on iOS without using that argument. As a result of that discussion, modifications to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/Python-Apple-support/pull/191">use CPython as a dynamically loaded framework</a> have been prepared. Although the original focus of this work was iOS, the same change will be also used for macOS - which means BeeWare no longer needs to compile a macOS support package (although we will still be lightly re-packaging the official CPython installer).</li>
<li>We modified Toga's Image APIs so that <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2231">Pillow images can be used as source data</a>.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2230">switched CI testing of Android apps to use a Linux machine</a>. This wasn't previously possible, because Github didn't expose the necessary permissions in their Linux images; however, now that <em>is</em> possible, our Android tests run up to 5 times faster, and are less likely to be held up in CI because of availability of macOS testing machines.</li>
<li>We corrected an issue on macOS where an OS-level setting controlling the use of tabs could <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2218">cause test failures in the Toga test suite</a>.</li>
<li>There have been some extended discussions and draft PRs related to Toga's <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2244">Application base class</a>, and the addition of support for <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2238">status icons</a>. These PRs are still in active development, but they will open up some interesting possibilities for Toga apps when they are completed.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1550">Briefcase</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2229">Toga</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/pull/387">Rubicon ObjC</a> were all modified to use PEP621 metadata, removing the need for <tt class="docutils literal">setup.cfg</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">setup.py</tt>, and <tt class="docutils literal">MANIFEST.in</tt> files. As part of this change, we wrote a new <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/setuptools_dynamic_dependencies">setuptools plugin</a> to allow for dependencies to be dynamically defined.</li>
<li>We modified Briefcase so that <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1552">answers to the new project wizard</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1542">values for configuration settings when running commands</a> can be overridden at the command line. This is mostly useful for testing purposes - it's now possible to generate a project and build it against a local template or support package build without needing to modify a <tt class="docutils literal">pyproject.toml</tt> file or override input handling.</li>
<li>We refactored the new project wizard so that <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1524">support for GUI toolkits is generated by an extensible plugin</a>. Although we still ship with support for Toga, PySide, Pygame and PPB, this support is provided through a public interface, allowing other GUI toolkits to provide Briefcase with toolkit-specific modifications to the new project.</li>
<li>We switched the default Android skin used by Briefcase from the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1554">Pixel 3a device skin to the Pixel 7 skin</a>. This is an entirely cosmetic change, but it does mean that screenshots will use a device that looks a little more modern.</li>
<li>We've made significant progress on the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/chaquo/chaquopy/milestone/3">modifications to Chaquopy to support CPython 3.12</a>. This support will hopefully be released at the same time as the upcoming Android Studio &quot;Hedgehog&quot; release.</li>
<li>We've made significant progress on running CPython's unit test suite on iOS in a CI configuration.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-s-next">
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>We won't see as much progress as normal in December as a result of the end-of-year holidays. However, before we sign off for the year, we're hoping to start looking at OptionContainer on mobile platforms, and possibly start looking at Camera API support.</p>
