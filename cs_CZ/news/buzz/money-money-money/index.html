  <p>At PyCon AU 2015, and again at DjangoCon US 2015, I gave a talk entitled
"Money Money Money: Writing software, in a rich (wo)man's world". The
talk was a summary of the issues around one of the biggest problems that
I see facing the open source community: how to provide the resources
that are needed to develop and maintain the software that we, as a
community depend upon. This means providing maintenance and support for
established projects, large and small; but also providing an ecosystem
where new ideas can be incubated, developed and matured until they
present compelling alternatives or significant benefits over closed
source offerings.</p>
<p>It's been almost 18 months since I first presented this talk, but the
issue persists. I haven't been alone in noticing and drawing attention
to this issue, either. <a href="https://twitter.com/nayafia">Nadia Eghbal</a> was
commissioned to write a white paper for the Ford Foundation entitled
<a href="http://www.fordfoundation.org/library/reports-and-studies/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure">Roads and
Bridges</a>
highlighting the chronic need for resources to support the basic
infrastructure that underpins large parts of the modern economy. Eric
Holscher (maintainer of <a href="https://readthedocs.com">Read the Docs</a>)
<a href="http://ericholscher.com/blog/2016/aug/31/funding-oss-marketing-money/">blogged about the problems he's had raising
funds</a>,
despite the fact that the service he delivers is a widely used -
arguably indispensable - part of the Python ecosystem.</p>
<p>However, despite this attention, it <em>still</em> doesn't get anywhere near as
much attention as it should. And it's an issue that is of pressing
importance to me, as the BeeWare project is looking for ways to fund the
development needed to take us from "interesting technical demo" to
"compelling technical solution".</p>
<p>A few months back, it was suggested that I should publish a blog post to
accompany the video presentation. I dragged my feet on doing this, until
industrious BeeWare contributor and all-around nice guy <a href="http://eliasdorneles.github.io">Elias
Dorneles</a> offered to take my speakers
notes and convert it into a transcript.</p>
<p>So - here it is. Money Money Money: Writing software, in a rich

<p>Hi, I'm Russell Keith-Magee, if you've heard of me before, it's probably
because of my work on the Django project; I've been a core team member
for almost 10 years, and president of the Django Software Foundation
since 2011.</p>
<p>One of the big challenges of the Django project - and any big project
for that matter - has been to secure certainty in its development
future.</p>
<p>My day job is as CTO and co-founder of TradesCloud. We’re a Software as
a Service for tradespeople -- plumbers, electricians, carpenters and the
like. TradesCloud depends on a number of open source projects - Django,
Apache, memcache, countless others. So I've got a business interest in
the continuity of these open source projects - but I certainly don't
have the resources to fund them <em>all</em> myself.</p>
<p>I've also got a declared interest in GUI/UI issues, especially as they
relate to development tools. I've got grand visions of what I'd <em>like</em>
to do with this project, and I've received some great contributions from
the community, but it's still largely my own work. But my startup would
be able to make great use of these tools if they were mature.</p>
<p>I've also a maintainer of some smaller projects, like the Python wrapper
to the Xero API. I started the project because I had an itch; and my
itch has been scratched. But now I've open sourced that project, which
means I've inherited a maintenance task. I've accepted help from a
couple of people - most notably Matthew Schinkel and Aidan Lister, who
have done great work. But if I'm honest, the maintenance burden of
PyXero well exceeds the time I can reasonably dedicate to it.</p>
<p>So - I've got vested interests in free software. I've got an interest as
a producer of a successful project with a high profile; as the producer
of a small project with lots of users but little personal incentive; and
as a producer of smaller projects with almost no profile but grand
plans. These projects all have different resourcing needs, reflecting
their maturity as projects.</p>
<p>I've also got interests as a consumer of free software - both in terms
of the software I rely on to develop my own projects, and in terms of my
commercial interest in the long term maintenance of tools and platforms.
I need these projects to continue to develop, survive and thrive.</p>
<p>Based on my experience, I'd like to make a bold assertion:</p>
<blockquote><p>Absent of any other constraints, given equivalent resources, the free
software approach produces vastly superior engineering outcomes than
the closed-source approach.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The catch is the operative clause "given equivalent resources". Most
free software projects aren't developed using anything close to
"equivalent" resources.</p>
<p>In some cases, this is a blessing in disguise - regardless of the
project, having scarce resources is an excellent crucible for burning
away the unnecessary to leave only the base metal. But it's not always a
blessing.</p>
<h3>The moral high road is littered with the corpses of our allies</h3>
<p>Talk to any prominent free software developer, and amongst the success
stories, you'll also hear some consistent troubles - that they've got
great ideas and grand plans, but no time to execute; that they're about
to burn out due to the pressures of maintaining their project; or that
they've had yet another mailing list discussion with someone who doesn't
understand why you didn't drop everything to help them fix their
problem. And there are plenty of examples.</p>
<p>OpenSSL is the software that drives pretty much every "secure"
connection on the internet - and yet it took until the discovery of
Heartbleed - a critical vulnerability that sent the internet into a
tailspin - before it could find funding to pay for maintainers.</p>
<p>Another example - GnuPG - Werner Koch almost went bankrupt trying to
support GPG - a project that many others depends upon for trust in their
release process. He was rescued, at deaths door, by the Linux
Foundation's Core Infrastructure initiative.</p>
<p>Those are both examples that ended with funding; but it's not all happy
endings.</p>
<p>Take the example of Capistrano. Hugely popular configuration management
tool around 2007-8, maintained by Jamis Buck. In 2008, citing burnout
and maintenance overhead, he famously withdrew support for Windows,
saying "Windows may be the 800 pounds gorilla in the room, but it's not
my gorilla, and it's not in my room". This was an incredibly unpopular
move; but even with that scale down, Jamis burned out in 2009,
abandoning Capistrano, and a number of other projects, without
maintainers.</p>
<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;Hi I&#39;m an engineer at a well-funded company and we need this feature can someone implement it for free?&quot; -- Every FOSS mailing list.</p>&mdash; Christophe (@Xof) <a href="https://twitter.com/Xof/status/622113231218192384">July 17, 2015</a></blockquote></p>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>The thing is - that this is a community that has lots of cash. In the
grand scheme of things, software development is a well funded industry.
If companies can find money for foosball tables and meditative ball
pits, they should be able to find resources to help maintain the
software on which they've based their success. And if you're on the
receiving end of the problem - a developer of free software - that can
be really frustrating.</p>
<p>For me, this is the great unanswered question of the free software
movement - how to reconcile the discrepancy between the clear demand for
a software product, and the ability to convert that demand into the time
and resources needed to service that demand.</p>
<h3>Free software: Dream vs Realty</h3>
<p>Although the theory says that anyone can contribute to a free software
project, in reality, every single project of any significance has
leaders. At the most basic level, it's whoever has the commit bit. And
you need that leadership, especially when anything to do with design is
involved. The running gag is that a camel is a horse designed by
committee. The worst APIs we deal with on a daily basis are the ones
that were designed by committee. You need someone with taste running the
show.</p>
<p>But there's a bigger problem - there's the extent of the engagement that
users have with a project. Here's a though experiment to prove my point.
We're in a room full of Python users. Django is a free software project.</p>
<ul>
<li>Who in this room has found a bug in Django, or has a niggling thing
they'd like to see fixed Django API?</li>
<li>Who has turn that niggle into a bug report to Django?</li>
<li>Who has submitted a patch to Django for that niggle?</li>
<li>Of those, who have had that patch committed?</li>
</ul>
<p>Poznámka</p>
<p>When this is done in front of a live audience, at each question, there
are less people raising their hands</p>
<h3>Products vs Projects</h3>
<p>So what's going on here? Well, it reflects 2 different ways of looking
at a piece of software - Projects and Products. And it's a matter of
personal perspective - my project can be your product, and vice versa.</p>
<p>When I view some code as a project, it's a body of code where I'm
contributing to a larger goal. I'm willing to spend resources focussing
on other people's needs in the hope that their needs will help make the
project as a whole better. I'm willing to do this because I get some
personal gain, like an enhanced public profile; or if the tool is really
close to my work coalface; or where I know I can make a substantive
contribution.</p>
<p>But the further I get away from my coalface, and the harder it is to
make a contribution, the less inclined I am to even <em>want</em> to contribute
to the project. Most of the time, it's a product that I'm using, warts
and all. If a product has bugs, I'll work around them, or find an
alternative, rather than navigating the contribution process and
contributing a patch back upstream.</p>
<p>In the case of a product, the freedoms afforded by Free software are a
bit like freedom of speech - it's a freedom I definitely want, it's
comforting to know it's there, but I don't spend every day making sure
that I fully exploit the extents of those freedoms. There are people who
do - protestors, advocates for controversial social positions - and one
day, given the right circumstances, I might join in and help them. But
most of the time, I just want to be pragmatic, and get on with living.</p>
<p>This dichotomy between the theory and practice is also the reason why
comments like "Patches Welcome" get made in Free software mailing lists.
On the one hand, it's completely correct. Anyone <em>can</em> contribute, and
on most projects <em>patches</em> are welcome. But most people don't look at a
new open source project as an opportunity to engage and contribute. Most
people just want to use the damn software.</p>
<p>And you can argue it's because people are focussing on the wrong
interpretation of "free", and haven't "captured the spirit of free
software". Which is 100% true, but utterly counterproductive as a
position. Anyone who has done any UX work knows that if users are
consistently making a mistake, blaming the user gets you nowhere. You
were in charge of what the user experienced, and they made the "error"
because of a fundamental cognitive disconnect.</p>
<p>And even if everyone <em>did</em> get the right message - let's be realistic -
it wouldn't work anyway. The mythical man month showed us that you don't
deliver a project faster or better by throwing more people at it. 9
women can't make a baby in 1 month - a project doesn't just need
resources - it needs the <em>right</em> resources, in the right quantities. And
ultimately, that means projects finding a way to get the resources they
need to be self sustaining.</p>
<p>So, that means that if we want free software to be maintained, and
maintained well, we need to find a way to fund it's maintenance.</p>
<h3>Use value vs Sale value</h3>
<p>18 years ago, Eric S Raymond published an essay entitled "Cathedral and
the Bazaar". This essay catalyzed the start of the open source
movement - a redefinition of "free software" to make it clear that the
openness, not price, was the important property. What isn't as well
remembered is that "Cathedral and the Bazaar" isn't the only essay
Raymond wrote at that time. He published 2 other essays shortly after
CatB - "Homesteading the Noosphere", about the social organization and
motivations behind free software projects, and The Magic Cauldron, about
the <em>economics</em> of Free software.</p>
<p>One of the key distinctions that Raymond highlights in that essay is the
difference between Use value and Sale value.</p>
<p>The sale value of a product is its value as a salable commodity -
literally, what you sell it for.</p>
<p>The use value of a product is its economic value as a tool, as a
productivity multiplier. This is how much economic benefit the user will
get from the product.</p>
<p>The important the is that the two aren't necessarily connected. In a
traditional manufacturing environment, the focus is on sale value,
because that's usually linked to the manufacturing cost - the cost of
parts and materials.</p>
<p>But most software isn't produced for sale value - it's in house software
produced for use value. In the case of free software, the "sale" value
for free software is 0. But that doesn't mean there isn't use value, and
the catch is to work out how to exploit the use value that exists within
an organization as a monetization channel.</p>
<p>So, what are your options?</p>
<p>Well, you can sell merchandise. And while this is relatively easy to do,
lets be honest - you're not going to fund a software empire selling
t-shirts.</p>
<p>You can get users to pay for documentation. Write a book, get users to
pay for it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the dirty little secret of the tech writing scene is that
nobody gets rich writing tech books. They're incredibly valuable
resources for the community, they're great for padding your resume, but
not so great as a revenue stream.</p>
<p>One area that <em>does</em> pay well is selling training. Employers are willing
to pay big bucks for training courses; if you can put together a 3 day
intensive workshop, you can sell it over and over again.</p>
<p>You can productize your offering. The source code remains free, but a
simple, easy-to-use installer costs money. This works really great when
when what you have is a clearly identifiable product - like an IDE.</p>
<p>One specific model of productization is SaaS - give the code away for
free, but pay for the convenience of having someone else administer it
for you. Any open source web software is a good example of this - you
can install the software on your own servers, but honestly, unless
you've got a reason, you use someone elses hosted solution and let them
take care of it for you.</p>
<p>But, SaaS is only viable if you can deliver <em>as a service</em> - which means
it's really only viable for web. And, as technologies like docker
commodify deployment, it's possible that even this revenue stream might
evaporate.</p>
<p>So what else can you sell?</p>
<p>You can sell access to the developers. If you're the maintainer of a
project, you're in the best position to provide support, or debug
complex problems - which means you're in a prime position to sell
support and consulting. <span class="title-ref">Honza Král
&lt;https://twitter.com/honzakral&gt;</span> from ElasticSearch calls
this the "Ghostbusters" business model - "Who you gonna call?"</p>
<p>You can sell access to the software. Trolltech did this with Qt;
Riverbank still does with the PyQt bindings. The library itself is GPL -
but if you want to use it on a closed source project, you can, for a
hefty fee. This has the advantage that it forces commercial interests to
pay for what they're using; but it also discourages small scale
commercial tinkering - if I'm writing a new tool, and I'm forced to
choose between open sourcing my tool or a $1000 price tag, I'll probably
choose a different toolkit.</p>
<p>You can also get into the business of providing certifications and
guarantees - auditing code to ensure quality or compatibility, providing
guarantees about fixing bugs, and certifying that individuals are
skilled in the use of the product. This is a big part of RedHat's
business model - auditing packages, making sure they all interoperate as
expected, ensuring that security updates are available and meet the same
standards, and certifying system administrators.</p>
<p>This is a set of products that appeals to the "enterprise" high end of
town - and that's is a lucrative end of the market. But those customers
also tend to only want these guarantees for certain types of software -
broadly speaking, "Boring fuddy-duddy" software. Your operating system,
your database - these are pieces of software that need to be rock solid
in an enterprise setting. Your debug toolbar - not so much, unless maybe
they've being wrapped as part of a suite of tools.</p>
<h4>Undermining your value proposition</h4>
<p>Another problem with many of these revenue sources is that if you run
your project well, a lot of them are ruled out - or at least severely
curtailed.</p>
<p>If you make something truly simple to use, you've just removed the need
for books and training courses - or, at the very least, moved the ground
to "advanced" courses - which are harder to write, and have a smaller
audience.</p>
<p>Django saw this first hand - Django's documentation was famously very
good from a very early stage, and as a result, it was quite hard to get
publishers to take on Django book projects - because the documentation
was too good, and was undermining the market for books. It's taken a
long time, and mostly self-publishing, to get good Django books
available for sale.</p>
<p>If you have a project mailing list, where the community answers
questions for free, and it's a healthy, responsive mailing list... why
would I pay for support?</p>
<p>If your software is well designed, and modular, and those interfaces are
well documented, and I need a modification - why wouldn't I just write
the mod myself?</p>
<p>Now, Ok - I'm exaggerating. There are legitimate reasons to pay for
support or to bring in a consultant even if the interfaces are clean and
well documented. But my point is that the better you do a job as a free
software engineer, it becomes harder to make the business case for your
revenue stream, because the value proposition becomes less obvious.</p>
<p>And if it isn't directly undermining your value proposition, it can
still undermine you indirectly, because the more time you spend earning
money, the less you spend doing what the money pays for. Administering a
certification program takes time. Writing and delivering training
courses takes time. Consulting can be lucrative, but developing a sales
pipeline takes time. And if you're consulting, you need to make sure
that sales pipeline is full, which means you're going to err on the side
of taking on more work than less... which means you've just closed the
door on the the time you have available to work on open source.</p>
<p>You also need to be careful that in selling your business case, you
don't undermine your main project. If every hard question on the mailing
list is answered "We can answer that for a fee", you're going to sound
like a shill.</p>
<p>If a project says it needs money to make sure we stay on top of security
issues... you have to be really careful how you say it, because the easy
interpretation is "well, the project must be insecure, because they're
not on top of security now".</p>
<h3>A question of scale</h3>
<p>There's also a question of scale. Python, Django - these are large
projects with large communities. Making a business case for Python or
Django isn't too hard. Not trivial, but possible. But is the maintainer
of a smaller project - like, say Django Debug Toolbar - are they
seriously expected to write and sell a book about Debug Toolbar? Or
training and certification in its use?</p>
<p>Smaller projects are no less important to the vitality of the overall
Django ecosystem, but those projects aren't afforded the same
opportunities for fundraising as larger projects.</p>
<p>It's also important to realize that not all products are afforded all
these opportunities for revenue. An IDE can be productized; a developer
library probably can't. Different projects will need different mixes of
revenue streams.</p>
<h3>Do you have to sell something?</h3>
<p>Ok - but can we do this without selling anything at all?</p>

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>Free software stems from a moral imperative - so can we fund development
through altruism and patronage? Well, it's harder, but there's evidence
that it can be done.</p>
<h4>Crowdfunding and Bug Bounties</h4>
<p>One option that has seen a lot of activity recently is crowdfunding.
Platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo provide a way to a group of
people to pitch in and contribute to a goal.</p>
<p>The Django community has a couple of examples of very successful
crowdfunding projects, each raising tens of thousands of dollars (Django
Migrations, Multiple Template engines, django.contrib.postgres, Django
Rest Framework). But - if you survey the people who did these projects,
they didn't make money on these projects. The amount of engineering time
that went into them well exceeded the money raised.</p>
<p>Another idea that gets floated regularly is the idea of bug bounties -
placing a price on specific bugs. This is really just another form of
crowdfunding - You want a specific bug fixied or feature added?
Contribute money. You <em>really</em> want it - contribute more. And eventually
someone will take the bait and fix the bug or implement the feature.</p>
<p>It's an attractive model - but it also has problems - most notably, Who
gets paid. Do you pay by lines of code written? That ignores the
contribution of reviewers. How much more important than writing code is
reviewing code or triaging a bug?</p>
<p>But the biggest problem I see with crowdfunding approaches is that they
are in conflict with establishing a working income. If you're hiring
yourself out, the shorter the engagement, the higher your hourly rate.
This is a hedge against unemployment at the end of the contract. If
you're doing a Kickstarter, you're best served by having a small,
clearly described, clearly achievable goal. So - a month or two of work.</p>
<p>That means you need to charge your short term rate in order to guarantee
long term income. But it's also in your interest to have a low
fundraising target, so that the campaign actually tips. If it's too
high, it could scare off potential bidders. It also means the community
pays a premium for any new feature, which isn't the best use of already
scarce community resources.</p>
<h4>Grants, Fellowships, Patreon</h4>
<p>Ok - so if you want longer term income, you need to look at longer term
engagements. That means that you stop looking at funding specific
projects, and start looking at funding the person, with grants and
fellowship positions.</p>
<p>I'm including Patreon in that list because it's effectively
"crowdsourced patronage". You're not paying for a specific thing - it's
"keep doing what you're doing" money.</p>
<p>Over the last 10 months, Django has been using this model. We hired a
fellow at the end of last year. The fellow - whose name is Tim Graham -
is responsible for keeping the project wheels greased.</p>
<p>From a technical perspective, this has been a roaring success. Tim's
made great inroads into our ticket backlog, and response times on ticket
reviews are lower than they've ever been.</p>
<p>The hard part has been raising the money to pay him.</p>
<p>We did a fundraiser at the start of the year specifically to fund the
Fellow; that campaign has raised just over $50k US. That's no small
chunk of change - but it's also not a lot when you're talking about a
full time employee. We're going to need to do another fundraiser really
soon if the Fellowship is going to continue.</p>
<p>Almost everyone agrees it's been money well spent, but converting that
into donations has been hard work.</p>
<h4>Corporate sponsorship</h4>
<p>Another other approach for raising money is to embrace the devil, and go
commercial. Commercial interests have the money, so why shouldn't they
pay for it? This can be very successful under certain circumstances -
but you have to be able to make a business case for the corporate owner.</p>
<p>OpenStack is a great example of this. Why are Rackspace, HP, Redhat,
Ubuntu all interested in OpenStack? Because they sell products that
benefit from commodifying the hosting environment. By making it cheap
and easy to control cloud deployments, they increase the size of the
market for cloud hosting, which means more money for their core
business - either directly (like Rackspace), or indirectly (like RedHat,
because cloud servers still need operating systems).</p>
<p>Node.js is funded by Joyent for similar reasons - Joyent is making a
long play that if it's easier to develop web software, more people will
write web software, increasing the market for Joyent's services.</p>
<p>However, Node.js is also a cautionary tale about corporate interests -
what happens when the community and the corporate sponsor disagree about
the direction of the project? Well, you get project splits, like the
io.js split. Corporate money can corrupt. You need to be careful that
project governance is independent of the funding source.</p>
<p>Having a single corporate master also puts the project the risk if that
corporate master loses interest. Django was originally under the wing of
the World Company. Eventually, that interest waned, and the corporate
support dried up, too.</p>
<h4>Venture funding</h4>
<p>The other corporate answer that gets floated is to go get venture money.
And there are some examples out there of people doing this. Meteor, for
example, is funding their development with money from a venture fund.
They've got plenty of money to hire engineers, designers - whatever they
need.</p>
<p>What makes me nervous about this model? We've been here before. Who here
remembers Eazel? For those who don't remember, In the late 90s, Eazel
was a dot-com company founded to develop the Nautilus file manager. And,
we got 2 years of open source code. And then the bubble burst, and the
company went bust. Now, the good thing is that we still have the code.
But it would be better to have the code still being actively developed.</p>
<h3>Developing a patronage culture</h3>
<p>And again, all this discussion is happening in an industry where billion
dollar valuations are kicking around.</p>
<p>Large parts of our industry, are built on a foundation of FOSS - but
those with the most capacity to contribute, in many cases, aren't
contributing.</p>
<p>Some are - there are some companies that do give huge amounts back to
open source communities. But there are also a lot of companies that
don't give back.</p>
<p>And even those that <em>do</em> give back - many of them give the help they're
able to give, which isn't necessarily the help that is needed. The
Django Software Foundation regularly receives offers for free or
subsidized hosting from hosting providers. And don't get me wrong -
that's great, and incredibly useful.</p>
<p>But what we really need is someone on the payroll to review bugs.
Earlier on in the lifecycle of Django, we needed people to write new big
features. We're in a constant need of graphic designers, artists, tech
writers. We need people who know how to do sysadmin, and community
outreach. And we don't need 400 people donating 1 hour; we need 10 very
specific people donating 40 hours.</p>
<p>When a disaster hits, organizations like the Red Cross call for
donations. And they will usually say "please give us money, not tins of
food or blankets". The reason? Money can buy what is needed. You can't
control what people donate, and even if they do happen to donate exactly
what you need, there's a huge logistic task of working out what has been
donated, and getting it where it's needed.</p>
<p>FOSS projects are much the same - they require resources. Some companies
donate in kind, and that's great, but it's rarely what is needed, and
it's easy to get distracted working out what to do with all resources
that have been donated, but you don't have an immediate use for.</p>
<p>And sadly, just as with charities - many companies don't donate at all.
And I'm not claiming these companies are being deliberately malicious in
not funding open source - if anything, we as a community have failed
them because we haven't helped them help us.</p>
<p>Most importantly, we don't have a mechanism in place to make it easy to
spend money, and easy to receive money. The current state of affairs
clearly demonstrates that it's not enough that there is a lot of money
in a community - you have to make the mechanism for donating that money
as obvious and seamless as possible, and you have to have someone to
direct that money towards.</p>
<p>One model community that I think does this really well is the Wordpress
community. Wordpress is GPL'd software. There are books, videos, blogs
on how to write wordpress plugins and themes - the same as there would
be for any open source software community. But critically, there are
also books, videos and blogs on how to make a <em>business</em> writing
Wordpress plugins and themes. Wordpress is GPL. And therefore, so are
all the plugins. They've got a store where you can buy plugins (and get
free ones), and easily install them in your Wordpress instance.</p>
<p>The Wordpress ecosystem has fundamentally embraced the fact that money
needs to be part of the equation, and by doing so, they've created an
industry that is self-funding - and this, I'd argue, is one big reason
for the success of Wordpress as a platform.</p>
<h3>A controversial proposal</h3>
<p>In that vein, I'd like to make a controversial proposal.</p>
<p>What if <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi">PyPI</a> was a revenue stream? What
if, when I registered an application with
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi">PyPI</a>, I could specify a price - either
per install, or per version, or per-app, or per-month. When I
<span class="title-ref">pip install</span>, the cost just gets added to
my PyPI account, and I get a monthly charge on my credit card; and that
gets passed back to the developer projects.</p>
<p>If PyPI stats are to be believed, Django is downloaded from PyPI more
than 1 million times per month. If there was a 10c toll on each
download, that would raise $100,000 per month - enough to pay for 10
full-time well paid developers, or a metric buttload of diversity,
outreach, DjangoGirls, and community support.</p>
<p>You could also leverage PyPi dependency information to pay it forward -
if you're writing a project that depends on another, you could opt to
pass some of your revenue upstream. Or, request that downstreams provide
a tithe.</p>
<p>And then there's the biggest dependencies of all - PyPI and Python
itself. If PyPI took a small cut of the revenue raised, that could help
pay for the development and maintenance of PyPI - and potentially Python
as well.</p>
<p>You could also take some of the money collected and put it into a
development pool - so if there's a new project that needs some
bootstrapping cash to get started, or an established project that needs
some help for a big task (like a Python 3 upgrade), the community as a
whole can easily funnel money towards that project.</p>
<p>What about people who don't have money? Well, we can offer free passes.
You're at a DjangoGirls event? Use this promo code to get free access.</p>
<p>You can still give away your software at no cost. And it's still free
software - you're still delivering Python, so you're still going to get
the source. You could probably even make the signing up process
completely optional. All we'd be doing is paving the cowpath - making it
easy to collect a toll on the easy way to use your software.</p>
<p>I'm not going to say that any of this would be easy to implement.
Completely aside from any technical challenge and nailing down details,
it's a big philosophical change for the community, and that's a much
bigger issue. But this philosophical question about money is a
discussion that we, as a community need to have.</p>
<p>What we've got here is a tragedy of the commons. Everyone agrees this
software is good. Everyone knows that software needs to be maintained.
But why should one individual company take on the economic burden of
funding maintenance when their competitors are getting the benefit for
free?</p>
<h3>Learn from the MPAA and RIAA: Make it easy to do the right thing</h3>
<p>For me, the key lesson from the music and movie industry from the last
20 years is that if you make it easy to do the right thing, people will
do the right thing. If you make it simple and seamless for a large
company to swipe their credit card and get charged $100 a month for
using all this open source software that has been developed, they will.
Yes, people will cheat. Don't worry about it, as long as cheating isn't
easier than doing the right thing.</p>
<p>The biggest reason that this isn't happening right now is that it isn't
obvious what the "right" thing is. I could donate to the DSF or PSF...
but it's a bit fiddly to organize, and it's not clear where the money
goes... I could sign up to a few Patreons, or sign up to a bug bounty
program... but not everybody is there, and those that are aren't really
earning enough to make a living, and I don't want to just contribute
beer money.</p>
<p>So what are we to do? The short answer is "I don't know". There probably
isn't going to be a silver bullet. I'd like to think that a monetization
channel on PyPI would work, but I'll be the first to admit that it might
not be the answer, or there might be problems I haven't foreseen.</p>
<p>But I firmly believe this conversation about money is conversation we
have to have. Free software as a movement is over 30 years old. Open
source is almost 20. We've conquered the technical hurdles. We're even
conquered the policy hurdles. Now it's time to tackle how we make this a
long term sustainable industry, not just commercial interests exploiting
the naïveté of a stream of doe-eyed volunteers.</p>
<p>I'm actually going to take another slightly controversial position, and
<em>not</em> take questions at this point, for two reasons - firstly, because
this sort of talk is a magnet for "I have a comment, not a question"
responses; but also because this isn't a subject where I have the
answers.</p>
<p>This is a discussion we need to have as a community - and I'm eager to
have that discussion - just not on this stage.</p>
