  <h2><a href="/cs_CZ/news/buzz/2024q2-roadmap/">2024Q2 Roadmap</a></h2>
  <p class="meta">
    Posted by
    
      <a href="https://cloudisland.nz/@freakboy3742">Russell Keith-Magee</a>
    
    on 3 April 2024 
  </p>
  
  <p>Q1 2024 has seen some major progress - but as always, there's still
plenty of work to do. As always, this roadmap should be read as a guide
to what we aim to focus on over the coming quarter, rather than a hard
commitment of features that will be made available on a specific
deadline.</p>
<h2>Q1 progress</h2>
<p>The first quarter of 2024 has seen significant progress towards getting
iOS and Android to Tier 3 supported status in CPython. <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0738/">PEP
738</a> has been formally accepted by
the CPython steering committee, and the vast majority of the changes
needed to support <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/114099">iOS</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/116622">Android</a> have
either been merged, or received substantial review from the CPython core
team.</p>
<p>We've also made progress on a number of long standing feature requests
in Toga. We've added an OptionContainer for Android, so tab-based UIs
can be used on all platforms. We've added a MapView widget that works on
all desktop and mobile platforms. We've also added the start of hardware
APIs, including Camera and Geolocation APIs.</p>
<h2>Q2 priorities</h2>
<p>Our Q2 goals are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Get iOS and Android to Tier 3 supported status</strong>. We expect to
finish upstreaming the patches we have for CPython early in the
quarter. However, Tier 3 status also requires CI infrastructure to
verify that the platforms are stable. In Q2, we will commission
buildbots so that CPython's CI is able to verify the ongoing stability
of iOS and Android as a platform.</li>
<li><strong>Extend the BeeWare tutorial</strong>. The BeeWare tutorial provides a good
introduction to using Briefcase and Toga, but there are a number of
common support questions that aren't covered by the tutorial, and some
features that we've added since the tutorial last saw significant
edits. We're going to revisit the tutorial, adding some extra steps to
cover these new features and common issues.</li>
<li><strong>Attend PyCon US 2024</strong> We're presenting a tutorial and a talk; we
will have a booth in the community section; we'll be there for the
full duration of the sprints; and we're also expecting to attend the
language summit. It's going to be a busy 2 weeks - we hope we see you
there!</li>
<li><strong>Start working on packaging for mobile platforms</strong>. PEP 730 and PEP
738 cover the core of CPython itself, but Python is much more than
just the core interpreter and standard library. There's also the
ecosystem of third-party libraries, many of which have binary
components. In this quarter, we're going to start looking at the
changes that are needed to make it easy for the community to start
packaging wheels for iOS and Android.</li>
<li><strong>Modify the App class to support other types of apps</strong>. This includes
adding an API for a "Simple App" that doesn't have a menu bar,
finalising the API for document-based apps, and providing an API for
system tray apps.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Longer term goals</h2>
<p>Completing PEP 730 and 738 is a major milestone - but there's still a
lot of work to be done. It will take a lot of time and community
education before iOS and Android binary packages are widely available.
We intend to do whatever we can to support the community, ranging from
documentation, to tooling support, to submitting patches to upstream
packages.</p>
<p>One of the ways to accelerate this transition will be to make iOS and
Android compelling platforms to support. This means adding more
capabilities to Toga, so that there aren't any capability gaps for a
user writing an app. It also means writing more documentation and
tutorials so that common app development tasks are well explained.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This month marks 2 years since full-time work began on BeeWare; and 10
years since the first commits on the project. We've come a long way in
that time - from a collection of cobbled-together proof of concept
demonstrators to a fully tested GUI platform, with equally tested
deployment tooling, and official support in CPython itself. The future
for Python as a GUI development platform on desktop and mobile has never
looked better, and we're excited to see what the coming years will
bring.</p>



  
  
  <h2><a href="/cs_CZ/news/buzz/march-2024-status-update/">March 2024 Status Update</a></h2>
  <p class="meta">
    Posted by
    
      <a href="https://cloudisland.nz/@freakboy3742">Russell Keith-Magee</a>
    
    on 2 April 2024 
  </p>
  
  <p>This month, we have less to report by raw feature count - but the
changes we <em>have</em> made represent extremely significant progress.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul>
<li>Our primary focus this month has been making the changes to CPython
needed to add support for
<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/114099">iOS</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/116622">Android</a>. We've made
major progress towards this goal: all the patches required for iOS
have been merged; a large number of patches have been submitted for
Android, with only a small number still required. This month, we have:<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/115918">Added test exclusions to support running the test suite on
Android</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/115955">Fixed some issues with the process of building an Android
libPython</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/116215">Modified sys.platform identification for Android so it returns
"android" not
"linux"</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/116674">Added an API to get device and OS information on
Android</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/116379">Modified ctypes so it can load libraries on
Android</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/116423">Modified a signals test to make it more reliable on more
platforms</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/116426">Added a build script and instructions for Android
builds</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/116454">Added a custom module loader so that iOS apps can load binary
modules from
Frameworks</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/116758">Modified test_doctest to support platforms that don't support
subprocesses</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/117052">Modified the standard library to support
iOS</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/117057">Added documentation for the iOS
platform</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/117299">Corrected some additional test failures introduced on
Android</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0738/">PEP 738</a>, adding official Android
support to CPython, has been formally approved by the Python Steering
Council.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/python/devguide/pull/1296">updated the CPython Developer Guide to describe the iOS
development process</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1687">improved Briefcase's handling of stdout for some
tools</a>. We're hoping
this will fix - or at least make it easier to diagnose - a mode of
failure we've had reported for the Android emulator on Windows.</li>
<li>We added <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1676">color to Android's log
output</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2415">corrected the handling of key shortcuts on Window and
GTK</a>, adding a lot of key
combinations that weren't previously possible to represent.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2463">restructured the Toga documentation landing
page</a>, making it easier to
find the documentation you're likely to need.</li>
<li>We landed the <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2379">MapView
widget</a>, and have completed
most of the work on a new <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2462">Geolocation
service</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>In April, we're hoping to wrap up the work on iOS and Android patches
for CPython, and add buildbots for those platforms. With the buildbots
in place, iOS and Android will officially be Tier 3 supported CPython
platforms. We also plan to revisit the BeeWare tutorial, adding some
more steps in preparation for a <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2024/schedule/presentation/41/">tutorial presentation at PyCon
US</a> in May. If
you're coming to Pittsburgh and you'd like to attend that tutorial
session, <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2024/attend/information/">ticket sales are
open!</a></p>
<h2>Want to get involved?</h2>
<p>Want to get involved? Here are some open issues that would be a great
place to get started with contributing to a BeeWare project. They're all
relatively minor changes, but would provide a big improvement to the
lives of BeeWare users:</p>

  <h2><a href="/cs_CZ/news/buzz/february-2024-status-update/">February 2024 Status Update</a></h2>
  <p class="meta">
    Posted by
    
      <a href="https://cloudisland.nz/@freakboy3742">Russell Keith-Magee</a>
    
    on 29 February 2024 
  </p>
  
  <p>February may be the shortest month, but that doesn't mean we've got any
less progress to report!</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0738/">PEP 738</a>, adding official Android
support to CPython, has been formally submitted to the Python Steering
Council for approval.</li>
<li>We've started landing patches in CPython to add formal support for
<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/114099">iOS</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/71052">Android</a>. There are
more patches in review, and more to come, but so far we've landed
patches that:<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/114876">Fix the compilation of the grp module on
Android</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/114889">Disable tests that can't run on mobile
platforms</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/115120">Refactor the CPython build system to allow for some of the oddities
of iOS as a platform</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/115390">Add build targets for compiling iOS-compatible
frameworks</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/115780">Correct the linking of extension modules on
Android</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/115917">Enable the concurrent.futures tests on platforms that don't support
multiprocessing</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We added macOS ARM64 machines to our CI capabilities for
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2404">Toga</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1652">Briefcase</a>. We've
officially supported ARM64 on macOS for some time, but we've been
unable to test this support as part of our CI and release procedure -
we've had to do ad-hoc testing on the machines we're using to develop
on a day to day basis. As a result of improvements to GitHub's CI
infrastructure, we're now able to perform automated testing. As part
of these changes, we've also added testing for Python 3.13 (which will
be released around October of this year).</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1930">added an API for detecting the displays attached to a computer,
and specifying the location of windows relative to those
displays</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2387">added a pluggable API for image
formats</a>. With this API,
any third party library that has an internal format for images can
implement support so that Toga can convert to and from images in that
format.</li>
<li>We've significantly improved shortcut key handling on GTK and
Winforms, including <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2415">improved coverage of non-alphanumeric
keys</a>, and support for
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2232">numpad keys</a>.</li>
<li>We've <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2379">added a MapView
widget</a>. This widget is in
final review, but should land very soon.</li>
<li>We've improved error handling when the <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1630">Android emulator fails to
start</a>. This should
hopefully make it easier to identify the source of any emulator
failures.</li>
<li>We've added the ability to run <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1603">Linux apps that have been built for
different platforms</a>.
Using Docker, it's now possible to run a Fedora system app on an
Ubuntu machine, or any other combination of supported platforms.</li>
<li>We've added the ability to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1661">pass extra arguments to Docker when
building images</a>.</li>
<li>We've <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1649">improved the console output for non-interactive
consoles</a> on some
long-running commands.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>In March, we will continue to focus on iOS and Android patches for
CPython; if all goes extremely well, the bulk of patches should be
upstream (or at least submitted for review) by the end of the month.
While we're waiting for CPython patches to be reviewed, we'll be adding
geolocation APIs to Toga.</p>
<h2>Want to get involved?</h2>

  </p>
  
  <p>January has seen some long awaited and high profile features added to
BeeWare.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0738/">PEP 738</a>, formalizing the
introduction of Android as a Tier 3 platform in CPython, has been
formally accepted as a draft. We're now revising the draft following
community feedback, in anticipation of submitting the PEP for formal
approval in the near future.</li>
<li>We added a cross-platform Camera API to Toga. This API has been
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2266">implemented for iOS and
macOS</a>; the <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2353">implementation
for Android</a> is in final
review.</li>
<li>We added an <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2350">OptionContainer widget for
Android</a>. This now means
that OptionContainer is available on every desktop and mobile
platform.</li>
<li>We added the ability to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2310">define a button with an
Icon</a>. In addition, we've
added some <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2348">major clarifications to the documentation about the
difference between an Icon and an
Image</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2320">reworked the way that widget IDs are
handled</a>. This change was
required due to a bug caused by the interaction of Python's garbage
collector and the widget registry that prevented the re-use of widget
IDs in some situations. The new implementation means that the widget
registry behaves a lot more like a browser's DOM - a widget can only
be discovered by ID when it is actually part of a widget layout.</li>
<li>We added Briefcase support for <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1596">Python 3.12 on
Android</a>.</li>
<li>We added a mechanism for <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1599">defining app
permissions</a> in your
Briefcase project.</li>
<li>We added the ability for Android projects to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1610">declare the native
Android libraries that they depend
on</a>.</li>
<li>We've been polishing the CPython patches necessary to support iOS and
Android, in anticipation of submitting these patches upstream. To
follow progress on this work, subscribe to the CPython tickets for
<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/114099">iOS support</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/71052">Android support</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>In February, we'll be focusing on the iOS and Android patches to
CPython, and the finalisation of <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0738/">PEP
738</a>. While we're waiting for CPython
patches to be reviewed, we'll be looking into geolocation and mapping
functionality.</p>
<h2>Want to get involved?</h2>
<p>Want to get involved? Here are some open issues that would be a great
place to get started with contributing to a BeeWare project. They're all
relatively minor changes, but would provide a big improvement to the
lives of BeeWare users:</p>

  <h2><a href="/cs_CZ/news/buzz/2024q1-roadmap/">2024Q1 Roadmap</a></h2>
  <p class="meta">
    Posted by
    
      <a href="https://mastodon.nz/@freakboy3742">Russell Keith-Magee</a>
    
    on 10 January 2024 
  </p>
  
  <p>It's the start of a new year, which means it's time to cast our minds
forward to what BeeWare will bring in the coming year. 2023 saw some
major milestones in stability and features; in 2024, we're going to
build on that foundation. As always, this roadmap should be read as a
guide to what we aim to focus on over the coming quarter, rather than a
hard commitment of features that will be made available on a specific
deadline.</p>
<h2>Q4 progress</h2>
<p>During the last quarter of 2024, we finally finished our audit and
testing of Toga. We now have 100% branch coverage on every line of
Toga's core, and on the macOS, Windows, GTK, Android and iOS backends.
We published <a href="https://pypi.org/project/toga/0.4.0/">Toga 0.4</a>,
incorporating all these changes - but it also meant that we were able to
start adding <em>new</em> features to Toga, including an OptionContainer widget
on iOS, and a draft of a Camera API for iOS and macOS. Toga's new test
framework has made adding these new features must easier - for example,
we were able to very rapidly identify (and resolve) gaps in
functionality in the new iOS OptionContainer widget by running the
existing test suite on a new implementation. We expect that this testing
foundation will continue to serve us well as we add more features in the
coming year.</p>
<p>The other major development for the quarter was the start of the
upstreaming process for Python on mobile platforms.
<a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0730/">PEP730</a>, proposing the addition of
iOS to the Tier 3 supported list of CPython core, has been ratified by
the steering council; and
<a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-738-adding-android-as-a-supported-platform/40975">PEP738</a>,
proposing the same for Android, is in draft form. The first patch
contributing towards iOS support has already landed.</p>
<h2>Q1 priorities</h2>
<p>Our Q1 goals are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Complete upstreaming iOS and Android support patches to CPython
core</strong>. We will finalise PEP738 and submit it for ratification; and
we'll continue upstreaming the iOS and Android patches that we've been
maintaining independently. This work has a hard deadline of May 7, as
that is when Python 3.13.0b1 is planned, which is the feature cutoff
for Python 3.13 development, so making sure we hit that deadline will
be our main priority.</li>
<li><strong>Add OptionContainer for Android</strong>. The implementation on iOS was
relatively straightforward; we have no reason to believe that the
Android implementation will be any more complicated.</li>
<li><strong>Complete the implementation of the Camera API</strong>. We have a draft PR
implementing a Camera API on macOS and iOS; we'll extend this API to
Android, and complete the work on Briefcase that is needed to add
support for permissions.</li>
<li><strong>Add an API for geolocation, and a Map widget</strong>. Geolocation is
another major hardware features that is common on phones; we need to
write a cross-platform layer for that hardware, plus add a native
mapping widget to show off this capability.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Longer term goals</h2>
<p>For the remainder of this year, you can expect to see three major themes
in BeeWare development.</p>
<p>Firstly, we're going to continue to work upstreaming the work BeeWare
has done in the mobile space into the wider CPython community. Once iOS
and Android have been incorporated into CPython core, the focus will
move to the packaging ecosystem. This means adding official support to
upload iOS and Android packages to PyPI, and making it easy for third
party projects to incorporate iOS and Android builds into their release
processes.</p>
<p>Secondly, we'll be increasing our efforts in education and training.
BeeWare has a tutorial that we're extremely proud of - but there are
many things we could add to that tutorial, and there are plenty of "How
To" and topic guides that could be written for those who have finished
the tutorial and want to try more advanced ideas.</p>
<p>Thirdly, we'll continue to expand the capabilities of Toga. There are a
handful of high profile widgets and capabilities that have been
patiently waiting for us to have a stable platform to build on, and the
spare capacity to implement them - features like a Radio Button widget,
Trees and Tables on mobile platforms, a cross-platform Settings API, and
cross-platform cloud file access.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>2024 promises to be a very exciting year for BeeWare. For the last 2
years, we've been focused on consolidating and stabilizing existing
features. That work is coming to a close, which will allow us to turn
our attention to building new features that show off the stable
foundation we've built, and to providing the resources that will allow
more users to try BeeWare for themselves.</p>

    on 31 December 2023 
  </p>
  
  <p>December has been a short month due to end-of-year holidays, but BeeWare
has still made some important progress.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0730/">PEP730</a>, formalizing the
introduction of iOS as a Tier 3 platform in CPython, has been
<a href="https://github.com/python/steering-council/issues/218#issuecomment-1839333665">ratified by the CPython Steering
Council</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/112738">first patch to CPython that explicitly mentions
iOS</a> has been merged.
This is a relatively minor change that is required for building
cross-platform binary modules; we'll start submitting more substantial
patches in the new year.</li>
<li><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0738/">PEP738</a>, formalizing the
introduction of Android as a Tier 3 platform in CPython, has been
drafted, and is <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-738-adding-android-as-a-supported-platform/40975">currently under
discussion</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://chaquo.com/chaquopy/chaquopy-version-15-0-1/">Chaquopy 15 was
released</a>,
adding support for Python 3.12 on Android. This release also improves
compatibility with Android Studio's transition away from Groovy,
towards Kotlin for configuration.</li>
<li>An <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2259">implementation of OptionContainer was added for
iOS</a>.</li>
<li>A number of improvements were made to image handling, including
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2263">optimizations when creating images from internal
APIs</a>, and a <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2276">correction to
flexible image resizing
behavior</a>.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2291">long standing bug that would cause macOS tables to
crash</a> was resolved.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2260">ability to define platform-specific
icons</a> was added to Toga.</li>
<li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/toga/0.4.1/">Toga 0.4.1 was released</a>,
incorporating the features and bug fixes from the last 2 months.</li>
<li>Work has begun on a <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2266">cross-platform Camera
API</a> . This currently works
on iOS, with a draft implementation on macOS. Before this work can
land, we need to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/547">add support in Briefcase for declaring
permissions</a>; a
design for this has been proposed, and will be implemented early in
the new year.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>When we return from the end-of-year break, we'll be back into developing
Toga. In the near future, you should see an OptionContainer on Android,
and permission support in Briefcase; once that work is wrapped, we'll
start looking at more more hardware APIs and missing widgets. You should
also start to see more patches land in CPython to support iOS, and the
finalisation of <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0738/">PEP 738</a>.</p>

  <h2><a href="/cs_CZ/news/buzz/november-2023-status-update/">November 2023 Status Update</a></h2>
  <p class="meta">
    Posted by

    on 1 December 2023 
  </p>
  
  <p>November has been a month of focus on the code that enables us to run
Python on iOS and Android - but there has still been some other high
profile developments in other parts of BeeWare.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0730/">PEP730</a>, formalizing the
introduction of iOS as a Tier 3 platform in CPython, has been
<a href="https://github.com/python/steering-council/issues/218">submitted to the Python Steering Council for
ratification</a>.</li>
<li>One of the major topics covered by the <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-730-adding-ios-as-a-supported-platform/35854">discussion about
PEP730</a>
was the use of a deprecated compiler argument. This led to some
re-examination of how CPython could be delivered on iOS without using
that argument. As a result of that discussion, modifications to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/Python-Apple-support/pull/191">use
CPython as a dynamically loaded
framework</a>
have been prepared. Although the original focus of this work was iOS,
the same change will be also used for macOS - which means BeeWare no
longer needs to compile a macOS support package (although we will
still be lightly re-packaging the official CPython installer).</li>
<li>We modified Toga's Image APIs so that <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2231">Pillow images can be used as
source data</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2230">switched CI testing of Android apps to use a Linux
machine</a>. This wasn't
previously possible, because GitHub didn't expose the necessary
permissions in their Linux images; however, now that <em>is</em> possible,
our Android tests run up to 5 times faster, and are less likely to be
held up in CI because of availability of macOS testing machines.</li>
<li>We corrected an issue on macOS where an OS-level setting controlling
the use of tabs could <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2218">cause test failures in the Toga test
suite</a>.</li>
<li>There have been some extended discussions and draft PRs related to
Toga's <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2244">Application base
class</a>, and the addition of
support for <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2238">status icons</a>.
These PRs are still in active development, but they will open up some
interesting possibilities for Toga apps when they are completed.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1550">Briefcase</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2229">Toga</a> and <a href="https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/pull/387">Rubicon
ObjC</a> were all
modified to use PEP621 metadata, removing the need for <code>setup.cfg</code>,
<code>setup.py</code>, and <code>MANIFEST.in</code> files. As part of this change, we wrote
a new <a href="https://github.com/beeware/setuptools_dynamic_dependencies">setuptools
plugin</a> to
allow for dependencies to be dynamically defined.</li>
<li>We modified Briefcase so that <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1552">answers to the new project
wizard</a> and <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1542">values
for configuration settings when running
commands</a> can be
overridden at the command line. This is mostly useful for testing
purposes - it's now possible to generate a project and build it
against a local template or support package build without needing to
modify a <code>pyproject.toml</code> file or override input handling.</li>
<li>We refactored the new project wizard so that <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1524">support for GUI toolkits
is generated by an extensible
plugin</a>. Although we
still ship with support for Toga, PySide, Pygame and PPB, this support
is provided through a public interface, allowing other GUI toolkits to
provide Briefcase with toolkit-specific modifications to the new
project.</li>
<li>We switched the default Android skin used by Briefcase from the <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1554">Pixel
3a device skin to the Pixel 7
skin</a>. This is an
entirely cosmetic change, but it does mean that screenshots will use a
device that looks a little more modern.</li>
<li>We've made significant progress on the <a href="https://github.com/chaquo/chaquopy/milestone/3">modifications to Chaquopy to
support CPython 3.12</a>.
This support will hopefully be released at the same time as the
upcoming Android Studio "Hedgehog" release.</li>
<li>We've made significant progress on running CPython's unit test suite
on iOS in a CI configuration.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>We won't see as much progress as normal in December as a result of the
end-of-year holidays. However, before we sign off for the year, we're
hoping to start looking at OptionContainer on mobile platforms, and
possibly start looking at Camera API support.</p>

  <p class="meta">

    on 1 November 2023 
  </p>
  
  <p>In October, we've (finally!) reached a major milestone - but there's
still lots of work to be done!</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>We finally finished the Toga audit!!</em>. We now have 100% test coverage
of all Toga code on macOS, Windows, Linux/GTK, iOS and Android, with a
consistent and fully documented API across all widgets. This has been
a truly mammoth project, resolving countless bugs, adding dozens of
new features, and improving platform support (especially on Windows
and Android). Once we've finalised a couple of housekeeping issues, we
will release Toga 0.4 incorporating all these changes. This will
hopefully occur later this week.</li>
<li>We attended the <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/2023-core-dev-sprint-in-brno-october-9-14/22868/21">Python Core Team
Sprint</a>
at the RedHat offices in Brno, Czechia. As a result of this
attendance, we produced a draft of <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-730-adding-ios-as-a-supported-platform/35854">PEP
730</a>,
which is the first step towards formalizing support for iOS in
CPython. An analogous Android PEP will be drafted once we've sorted
out the process around the iOS PEP (as this is the first time a
platform has gone through a formal process to be added to PEP 11's
Tier 3 list).</li>
<li>We reworked the build system for Apple support packages to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/cpython-apple-source-deps">separate
the compilation of
dependencies</a>
(like BZip2 and OpenSSL) from the compilation of Python itself. These
libraries are updated infrequently, and on a completely different
cadence to CPython itself, so treating them as re-usable resources
rather than something that needs to be compiled at the same time as
Python will significantly improve CPython build times.</li>
<li>We released <a href="https://pypi.org/project/briefcase/0.3.16/">Briefcase
0.3.16</a>, formalizing our
support for Python 3.12, and adding the new support for dynamic
libraries on iOS. This release also formally downgrades our support
for AppImage, following extended problems in supporting AppImage as an
output format.</li>
<li>We released <a href="https://pypi.org/project/rubicon-objc/0.4.7/">Rubicon ObjC
0.4.7</a>, formalising our
support for Python 3.12.</li>
<li>We modified Briefcase to ensure that <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1475">macOS apps are universal by
default</a>, with an

<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>Now that we've <em>finally</em> finished the widget audit, we can finally
release Toga 0.4, and start using the foundation that we've spent the
last 12 months building.</p>
<p>In November, we'll start the work of upstreaming iOS patches to CPython
core. The PEP we've drafted is nearing a form where it can be submitted
to the Steering Council for approval, but the drafting process has
raised a couple of technical issues that need to be investigated.
However, while we wait for formal acceptance of the PEP, we will
continue working on building continuous integration for our iOS CPython
builds, and begin preparing patches that can be merged into CPython.</p>

  <h2><a href="/cs_CZ/news/buzz/2023q4-roadmap/">2023Q4 Roadmap</a></h2>
  <p class="meta">
    Posted by

    on 3 October 2023 
  </p>
  
  <p>As 2023 rolls to a close, BeeWare is more stable than ever, and is
progressing well. However, there's still lots of work to be done. As
always, this roadmap should be read as a guide to what we aim to focus
on over the coming quarter, rather than a hard commitment of features
that will be made available on a specific deadline.</p>
<h2>Q3 progress</h2>
<p>During Q3, Toga testing continued to be a major focus area. We've
completed testing on macOS, GTK and Linux; and testing on Windows and
Android is nearing completion. Along the way, we've resolved dozens of
bugs, discovered (and resolved) dozens more, and we've been able to
eliminate a bunch of inconsistencies in naming and usage between
widgets. We've also substantially improved the API documentation for
widgets.</p>
<p>As noted in our monthly status reports, progress has been slower than
expected because of the large number of edge cases and platform
inconsistencies that we've found along the way. We're still a couple of
weeks away from completing this work; but once it's all completed, we'll
be able to publish a new version of Toga.</p>
<p>This quarter, we've also resolved a major known limitation on iOS -
binary module packaging. We are now able to confirm that BeeWare is able
to produce apps with dynamically loaded binary modules that the iOS App
Store will accept through their review process. In the process of
resolving this limitation, we've started developing a Forge for mobile
packages, significantly improving the tooling for building binary wheels
for iOS.</p>
<h2>Q4 priorities</h2>
<p>Our Q4 goals are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Finalize Toga's test suite</strong>. For real this time - we'll have 100%
branch coverage on every line of Toga's core, and on the macOS,
Windows, GTK, Android and iOS backends. Once we've released a version
of Toga that includes all these fixes, we'll be able to publish a plan
for the road to 1.0.</li>
<li><strong>Python 3.12 support</strong>. We're expecting Python 3.12.0 to drop any
day. We've already done some preliminary work on Python 3.12 support,
but we'll need to finalise that work once the final release is
available.</li>
<li><strong>Start upstreaming iOS and Android support to CPython</strong>. This
quarter, we'll begin the process of upstreaming the patches for iOS
and Android support that we've been maintaining to CPython core, and
developing the CI infrastructure to run CPython's full test suite on
iOS and Android. The eventual goal is for iOS and Android to be Tier 3
supported platforms in Python 3.13. This will take a while to
finalise, but we've got around 8 months until the feature freeze for
Python 3.13, so we're confident we can make this happen. We're
attending the CPython Core Team sprint this month to kick start this
effort.</li>
<li><strong>OptionContainer widget for iOS and Android</strong>. One of the big gaps
identified during the Toga audit was the lack of content navigation
widgets on iOS and Android. This quarter, we're going to start
addressing this gap, adding an OptionContainer widget. This widget
already exists for macOS, GTK and Windows, so we have an API design -
we just need to find a way to make this API work on mobile platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Image Capture</strong>. We're finally going to start addressing device
hardware capabilities. We're going to start with image capture - the
ability to select an image from either the photo library, or take an
image with the camera, and have that image available to Python code.
As well as implementing this API, we're going to need to tackle
permission handling in Briefcase so that apps can declare that they
need access to the camera in a cross-platform way.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Longer term goals</h2>
<p>Over the last 18 months, a major focus has been ensuring that the tools
we have are stable, tested, and fit for purpose. Looking forward, we'll
be able to build on this foundation, adding more widgets (especially for
app content navigation), and filling out notable gaps in widget platform
support (such as Tree and Table widgets on mobile). We'll also start
building out hardware support APIs (such as geolocation and
accelerometers).</p>
<p>However, in addition to adding new features, we're going to start
drawing attention to the features we already have. The Toga audit has
enabled us to revise our API documentation, but API documentation is
only a small part of the overall documentation story. Now that we have a
stable base to work with, we're going to start improving our tutorials
and HowTo documentation, lowering the barrier to entry for new
developers.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Toga and Briefcase are more stable than ever, and we've addressed all
the major technical challenges that existed when full-time work on
BeeWare started early last year. Now we can begin the work of building
on the foundation that we've established, ensuring that everyone in the
Python community can build native applications for their devices.</p>



  
  
  <h2><a href="/cs_CZ/news/buzz/september-2023-status-update/">September 2023 Status Update</a></h2>
  <p class="meta">
    Posted by
    
      <a href="https://cloudisland.nz/@freakboy3742">Russell Keith-Magee</a>
    
    on 30 September 2023 
  </p>
  
  <p>September has been a month of slow, but significant progress.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul>
<li>We've resolved the issues around the iOS App Store rejecting BeeWare
apps - and, by way of proof, we've updated our demo app, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/au/app/travel-tips/id1336372310#?platform=iphone">Travel
Tips</a>.
We've also updated the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.keith_magee.traveltips">Android version of the
app</a>.</li>
<li>We've completely reworked the tooling for building binary packages for
iOS. <a href="https://github.com/beeware/mobile-forge">Mobile Forge</a> is our
new project for maintaining iOS binary builds. It provides a much more
robust environment for performing cross-compilation, making use of
<a href="https://github.com/benfogle/crossenv">crossenv</a>, rather than bespoke
site package overrides. Getting crossenv working has also required us
to do a deep audit of the various ways that Python reflects describes
the platform it is running on, from the obvious ones like the
<code>platform</code> and <code>sys</code> modules, down to <code>sysconfig</code> and the tags that
are used by <code>pip</code> to determine wheel compatibility.</li>
<li>We've completed an <a href="https://github.com/beeware/Python-Apple-support">initial port of the iOS patches to Python
3.12.0rc3</a>. We're
still hunting some edge cases, but initial signs are promising that
we'll be in a position to do a near "zero day" release of Python 3.12
support for iOS.</li>
<li>For Android, we've re-enabled <a href="https://github.com/chaquo/chaquopy/pull/937">Fortran
support</a> in the package
build system, and used it to <a href="https://github.com/chaquo/chaquopy/pull/949">upgrade
SciPy</a>.</li>
<li>We were anticipating that would would complete the Toga Audit this
month; however, that unfortunately hasn't happened. We've hit a bunch
of complications with getting fonts and canvas support working on
Windows and Android, and the process of getting those platforms
working has revealed some inconsistencies in macOS, iOS and GTK font
handling. However, we have completed the audit of
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2019">DetailedList</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1903">Font</a>, and the audit of
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2029">Canvas</a> is <em>almost</em>
complete.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2112">decoupled the Winforms event loop from the main form in a Toga
app</a>. This doesn't have any
immediate impact on existing Toga apps - but it means we're now in a
position to have windowless apps, such as system tray apps.</li>
<li>We completed the <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1290">fixes needed to support Briefcase on Python
3.12</a>.</li>
<li>We made some <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1425">significant improvements to subprocess encoding
handling</a>. This should
significantly improve the user experience of Windows users, and users
from non-English speaking countries.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1449">formally downgraded our support for AppImage to "Best
effort"</a>. AppImage has
proven increasingly difficult to work with as a format; now that we
have native system packages and Flatpak as options, the effort needed
to maintain AppImage support is better spent elsewhere. We'll still
merge fixes to AppImage support if a PR is provided, but we're no
longer actively fixing bugs, or running AppImage configurations in CI.</li>
<li>We added <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1468">filters to Xcode output to hide ignorable
warnings</a>. Xcode
builds have always been a little noisy; the new Xcode 15 release added
even more noise. The filter means that these warnings will no longer
distract from successful build output.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, we didn't complete the Toga audit in September as we
anticipated. As mentioned, we hit a number of complications and
inconsistencies in font handling, especially in the Canvas widget, which
slowed progress. We'll keep working on this audit in October; and once
we're done, we'll make a release a new version of Toga. This release
will include a number of backwards-incompatible changes identified as
part of the audit, so be prepared for a bumpier-than-usual upgrade
process.</p>
<p>Once the audit is complete, we'll also be looking at a technical
limitation that the widget audit has revealed on Android. A number of
Toga's Android widgets aren't as fully featured as they could be, due to
the fact that accessing the full API would require subclassing a Java
base class. This is an area where Chaquopy has some limitations; so
we're going to try and address these limitations.</p>
<p>We'll also begin the work of upstreaming patches to CPython core. We've
been invited to attend the CPython Core Team Sprint this month, which
will be great opportunity to lay out the roadmap for formal iOS and
Android support in CPython 3.13. This will also involve working on
improving the CI infrastructure for building Android and iOS packages.</p>
