  </p>
  
  <p>January has seen some long awaited and high profile features added to
BeeWare.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0738/">PEP 738</a>, formalizing the
introduction of Android as a Tier 3 platform in CPython, has been
formally accepted as a draft. We're now revising the draft following
community feedback, in anticipation of submitting the PEP for formal
approval in the near future.</li>
<li>We added a cross-platform Camera API to Toga. This API has been
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2266">implemented for iOS and
macOS</a>; the <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2353">implementation
for Android</a> is in final
review.</li>
<li>We added an <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2350">OptionContainer widget for
Android</a>. This now means
that OptionContainer is available on every desktop and mobile
platform.</li>
<li>We added the ability to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2310">define a button with an
Icon</a>. In addition, we've
added some <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2348">major clarifications to the documentation about the
difference between an Icon and an
Image</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2320">reworked the way that widget IDs are
handled</a>. This change was
required due to a bug caused by the interaction of Python's garbage
collector and the widget registry that prevented the re-use of widget
IDs in some situations. The new implementation means that the widget
registry behaves a lot more like a browser's DOM - a widget can only
be discovered by ID when it is actually part of a widget layout.</li>
<li>We added Briefcase support for <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1596">Python 3.12 on
Android</a>.</li>
<li>We added a mechanism for <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1599">defining app
permissions</a> in your
Briefcase project.</li>
<li>We added the ability for Android projects to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1610">declare the native
Android libraries that they depend
on</a>.</li>
<li>We've been polishing the CPython patches necessary to support iOS and
Android, in anticipation of submitting these patches upstream. To
follow progress on this work, subscribe to the CPython tickets for
<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/114099">iOS support</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/71052">Android support</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>In February, we'll be focusing on the iOS and Android patches to
CPython, and the finalisation of <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0738/">PEP
738</a>. While we're waiting for CPython
patches to be reviewed, we'll be looking into geolocation and mapping
functionality.</p>
<h2>Want to get involved?</h2>
<p>Want to get involved? Here are some open issues that would be a great
place to get started with contributing to a BeeWare project. They're all
relatively minor changes, but would provide a big improvement to the
lives of BeeWare users:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/2251">Update the Toga testbed test suite to use Pixel 7 Pro device
sizes</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/780">Filter out a message generated after Xcode
updates</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/808">Add the ability to configure the ABIs built by an Android
project</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1099">Rationalise the application of adhoc signing on
macOS</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1270">Add support for custom PyPI
repositories</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1393">Document how to debug an application in popular
IDEs</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/394">Correctly handle incomplete project
deletions</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/737">Add an option to select the Android base image when creating new
emulators</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1472">Print notarisation log failures when building macOS
apps</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/2301">Add an API to replace a child of a
widget</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/2305">Add an API to entirely replace the style of a
widget</a></li>

  <h2><a href="/cs_CZ/news/buzz/2024q1-roadmap/">2024Q1 Roadmap</a></h2>
  <p class="meta">
    
Posted by

 10 January 2024
  </p>
  
  <p>It's the start of a new year, which means it's time to cast our minds
forward to what BeeWare will bring in the coming year. 2023 saw some
major milestones in stability and features; in 2024, we're going to
build on that foundation. As always, this roadmap should be read as a
guide to what we aim to focus on over the coming quarter, rather than a
hard commitment of features that will be made available on a specific
deadline.</p>
<h2>Q4 progress</h2>
<p>During the last quarter of 2024, we finally finished our audit and
testing of Toga. We now have 100% branch coverage on every line of
Toga's core, and on the macOS, Windows, GTK, Android and iOS backends.
We published <a href="https://pypi.org/project/toga/0.4.0/">Toga 0.4</a>,
incorporating all these changes - but it also meant that we were able to
start adding <em>new</em> features to Toga, including an OptionContainer widget
on iOS, and a draft of a Camera API for iOS and macOS. Toga's new test
framework has made adding these new features must easier - for example,
we were able to very rapidly identify (and resolve) gaps in
functionality in the new iOS OptionContainer widget by running the
existing test suite on a new implementation. We expect that this testing
foundation will continue to serve us well as we add more features in the
coming year.</p>
<p>The other major development for the quarter was the start of the
upstreaming process for Python on mobile platforms.
<a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0730/">PEP730</a>, proposing the addition of
iOS to the Tier 3 supported list of CPython core, has been ratified by
the steering council; and
<a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-738-adding-android-as-a-supported-platform/40975">PEP738</a>,
proposing the same for Android, is in draft form. The first patch
contributing towards iOS support has already landed.</p>
<h2>Q1 priorities</h2>
<p>Our Q1 goals are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Complete upstreaming iOS and Android support patches to CPython
core</strong>. We will finalise PEP738 and submit it for ratification; and
we'll continue upstreaming the iOS and Android patches that we've been
maintaining independently. This work has a hard deadline of May 7, as
that is when Python 3.13.0b1 is planned, which is the feature cutoff
for Python 3.13 development, so making sure we hit that deadline will
be our main priority.</li>
<li><strong>Add OptionContainer for Android</strong>. The implementation on iOS was
relatively straightforward; we have no reason to believe that the
Android implementation will be any more complicated.</li>
<li><strong>Complete the implementation of the Camera API</strong>. We have a draft PR
implementing a Camera API on macOS and iOS; we'll extend this API to
Android, and complete the work on Briefcase that is needed to add
support for permissions.</li>
<li><strong>Add an API for geolocation, and a Map widget</strong>. Geolocation is
another major hardware features that is common on phones; we need to
write a cross-platform layer for that hardware, plus add a native
mapping widget to show off this capability.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Longer term goals</h2>
<p>For the remainder of this year, you can expect to see three major themes
in BeeWare development.</p>
<p>Firstly, we're going to continue to work upstreaming the work BeeWare
has done in the mobile space into the wider CPython community. Once iOS
and Android have been incorporated into CPython core, the focus will
move to the packaging ecosystem. This means adding official support to
upload iOS and Android packages to PyPI, and making it easy for third
party projects to incorporate iOS and Android builds into their release
processes.</p>
<p>Secondly, we'll be increasing our efforts in education and training.
BeeWare has a tutorial that we're extremely proud of - but there are
many things we could add to that tutorial, and there are plenty of "How
To" and topic guides that could be written for those who have finished
the tutorial and want to try more advanced ideas.</p>
<p>Thirdly, we'll continue to expand the capabilities of Toga. There are a
handful of high profile widgets and capabilities that have been
patiently waiting for us to have a stable platform to build on, and the
spare capacity to implement them - features like a Radio Button widget,
Trees and Tables on mobile platforms, a cross-platform Settings API, and
cross-platform cloud file access.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>2024 promises to be a very exciting year for BeeWare. For the last 2
years, we've been focused on consolidating and stabilizing existing
features. That work is coming to a close, which will allow us to turn
our attention to building new features that show off the stable
foundation we've built, and to providing the resources that will allow
more users to try BeeWare for themselves.</p>

  </p>
  
  <p>December has been a short month due to end-of-year holidays, but BeeWare
has still made some important progress.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0730/">PEP730</a>, formalizing the
introduction of iOS as a Tier 3 platform in CPython, has been
<a href="https://github.com/python/steering-council/issues/218#issuecomment-1839333665">ratified by the CPython Steering
Council</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/112738">first patch to CPython that explicitly mentions
iOS</a> has been merged.
This is a relatively minor change that is required for building
cross-platform binary modules; we'll start submitting more substantial
patches in the new year.</li>
<li><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0738/">PEP738</a>, formalizing the
introduction of Android as a Tier 3 platform in CPython, has been
drafted, and is <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-738-adding-android-as-a-supported-platform/40975">currently under
discussion</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://chaquo.com/chaquopy/chaquopy-version-15-0-1/">Chaquopy 15 was
released</a>,
adding support for Python 3.12 on Android. This release also improves
compatibility with Android Studio's transition away from Groovy,
towards Kotlin for configuration.</li>
<li>An <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2259">implementation of OptionContainer was added for
iOS</a>.</li>
<li>A number of improvements were made to image handling, including
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2263">optimizations when creating images from internal
APIs</a>, and a <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2276">correction to
flexible image resizing
behavior</a>.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2291">long standing bug that would cause macOS tables to
crash</a> was resolved.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2260">ability to define platform-specific
icons</a> was added to Toga.</li>
<li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/toga/0.4.1/">Toga 0.4.1 was released</a>,
incorporating the features and bug fixes from the last 2 months.</li>
<li>Work has begun on a <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2266">cross-platform Camera
API</a> . This currently works
on iOS, with a draft implementation on macOS. Before this work can
land, we need to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/547">add support in Briefcase for declaring
permissions</a>; a
design for this has been proposed, and will be implemented early in
the new year.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>When we return from the end-of-year break, we'll be back into developing
Toga. In the near future, you should see an OptionContainer on Android,
and permission support in Briefcase; once that work is wrapped, we'll
start looking at more more hardware APIs and missing widgets. You should
also start to see more patches land in CPython to support iOS, and the
finalisation of <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0738/">PEP 738</a>.</p>

  </p>
  
  <p>November has been a month of focus on the code that enables us to run
Python on iOS and Android - but there has still been some other high
profile developments in other parts of BeeWare.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0730/">PEP730</a>, formalizing the
introduction of iOS as a Tier 3 platform in CPython, has been
<a href="https://github.com/python/steering-council/issues/218">submitted to the Python Steering Council for
ratification</a>.</li>
<li>One of the major topics covered by the <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-730-adding-ios-as-a-supported-platform/35854">discussion about
PEP730</a>
was the use of a deprecated compiler argument. This led to some
re-examination of how CPython could be delivered on iOS without using
that argument. As a result of that discussion, modifications to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/Python-Apple-support/pull/191">use
CPython as a dynamically loaded
framework</a>
have been prepared. Although the original focus of this work was iOS,
the same change will be also used for macOS - which means BeeWare no
longer needs to compile a macOS support package (although we will
still be lightly re-packaging the official CPython installer).</li>
<li>We modified Toga's Image APIs so that <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2231">Pillow images can be used as
source data</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2230">switched CI testing of Android apps to use a Linux
machine</a>. This wasn't
previously possible, because Github didn't expose the necessary
permissions in their Linux images; however, now that <em>is</em> possible,
our Android tests run up to 5 times faster, and are less likely to be
held up in CI because of availability of macOS testing machines.</li>
<li>We corrected an issue on macOS where an OS-level setting controlling
the use of tabs could <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2218">cause test failures in the Toga test
suite</a>.</li>
<li>There have been some extended discussions and draft PRs related to
Toga's <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2244">Application base
class</a>, and the addition of
support for <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2238">status icons</a>.
These PRs are still in active development, but they will open up some
interesting possibilities for Toga apps when they are completed.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1550">Briefcase</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2229">Toga</a> and <a href="https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/pull/387">Rubicon
ObjC</a> were all
modified to use PEP621 metadata, removing the need for <code>setup.cfg</code>,
<code>setup.py</code>, and <code>MANIFEST.in</code> files. As part of this change, we wrote
a new <a href="https://github.com/beeware/setuptools_dynamic_dependencies">setuptools
plugin</a> to
allow for dependencies to be dynamically defined.</li>
<li>We modified Briefcase so that <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1552">answers to the new project
wizard</a> and <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1542">values
for configuration settings when running
commands</a> can be
overridden at the command line. This is mostly useful for testing
purposes - it's now possible to generate a project and build it
against a local template or support package build without needing to
modify a <code>pyproject.toml</code> file or override input handling.</li>
<li>We refactored the new project wizard so that <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1524">support for GUI toolkits
is generated by an extensible
plugin</a>. Although we
still ship with support for Toga, PySide, Pygame and PPB, this support
is provided through a public interface, allowing other GUI toolkits to
provide Briefcase with toolkit-specific modifications to the new
project.</li>
<li>We switched the default Android skin used by Briefcase from the <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1554">Pixel
3a device skin to the Pixel 7
skin</a>. This is an
entirely cosmetic change, but it does mean that screenshots will use a
device that looks a little more modern.</li>
<li>We've made significant progress on the <a href="https://github.com/chaquo/chaquopy/milestone/3">modifications to Chaquopy to
support CPython 3.12</a>.
This support will hopefully be released at the same time as the
upcoming Android Studio "Hedgehog" release.</li>
<li>We've made significant progress on running CPython's unit test suite
on iOS in a CI configuration.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>We won't see as much progress as normal in December as a result of the
end-of-year holidays. However, before we sign off for the year, we're
hoping to start looking at OptionContainer on mobile platforms, and
possibly start looking at Camera API support.</p>

  </p>
  
  <p>In October, we've (finally!) reached a major milestone - but there's
still lots of work to be done!</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>We finally finished the Toga audit!!</em>. We now have 100% test coverage
of all Toga code on macOS, Windows, Linux/GTK, iOS and Android, with a
consistent and fully documented API across all widgets. This has been
a truly mammoth project, resolving countless bugs, adding dozens of
new features, and improving platform support (especially on Windows
and Android). Once we've finalised a couple of housekeeping issues, we
will release Toga 0.4 incorporating all these changes. This will
hopefully occur later this week.</li>
<li>We attended the <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/2023-core-dev-sprint-in-brno-october-9-14/22868/21">Python Core Team
Sprint</a>
at the RedHat offices in Brno, Czechia. As a result of this
attendance, we produced a draft of <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-730-adding-ios-as-a-supported-platform/35854">PEP
730</a>,
which is the first step towards formalizing support for iOS in
CPython. An analogous Android PEP will be drafted once we've sorted
out the process around the iOS PEP (as this is the first time a
platform has gone through a formal process to be added to PEP 11's
Tier 3 list).</li>
<li>We reworked the build system for Apple support packages to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/cpython-apple-source-deps">separate
the compilation of
dependencies</a>
(like BZip2 and OpenSSL) from the compilation of Python itself. These
libraries are updated infrequently, and on a completely different
cadence to CPython itself, so treating them as re-usable resources
rather than something that needs to be compiled at the same time as
Python will significantly improve CPython build times.</li>
<li>We released <a href="https://pypi.org/project/briefcase/0.3.16/">Briefcase
0.3.16</a>, formalizing our
support for Python 3.12, and adding the new support for dynamic
libraries on iOS. This release also formally downgrades our support
for AppImage, following extended problems in supporting AppImage as an
output format.</li>
<li>We released <a href="https://pypi.org/project/rubicon-objc/0.4.7/">Rubicon ObjC
0.4.7</a>, formalising our
support for Python 3.12.</li>
<li>We modified Briefcase to ensure that <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1475">macOS apps are universal by
default</a>, with an
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1482">option to request a single-architecture
build</a>.</li>
<li>We added a <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1470">deep debug logging
level</a> to Briefcase,
and <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1503">simplified the output of many other commands to ensure that
important warnings aren't
lost</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2151">added support for Undo and Redo operations on macOS text
widgets</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1399">added support for user-registered fonts on iOS and
macOS</a>.</li>
<li>We made some modifications to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2066">improve Toga's memory management when
creating and destroying
windows</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>Now that we've <em>finally</em> finished the widget audit, we can finally
release Toga 0.4, and start using the foundation that we've spent the
last 12 months building.</p>
<p>In November, we'll start the work of upstreaming iOS patches to CPython
core. The PEP we've drafted is nearing a form where it can be submitted
to the Steering Council for approval, but the drafting process has
raised a couple of technical issues that need to be investigated.
However, while we wait for formal acceptance of the PEP, we will
continue working on building continuous integration for our iOS CPython
builds, and begin preparing patches that can be merged into CPython.</p>

  </p>
  
  <p>As 2023 rolls to a close, BeeWare is more stable than ever, and is
progressing well. However, there's still lots of work to be done. As
always, this roadmap should be read as a guide to what we aim to focus
on over the coming quarter, rather than a hard commitment of features
that will be made available on a specific deadline.</p>
<h2>Q3 progress</h2>
<p>During Q3, Toga testing continued to be a major focus area. We've
completed testing on macOS, GTK and Linux; and testing on Windows and
Android is nearing completion. Along the way, we've resolved dozens of
bugs, discovered (and resolved) dozens more, and we've been able to
eliminate a bunch of inconsistencies in naming and usage between
widgets. We've also substantially improved the API documentation for
widgets.</p>
<p>As noted in our monthly status reports, progress has been slower than
expected because of the large number of edge cases and platform
inconsistencies that we've found along the way. We're still a couple of
weeks away from completing this work; but once it's all completed, we'll
be able to publish a new version of Toga.</p>
<p>This quarter, we've also resolved a major known limitation on iOS -
binary module packaging. We are now able to confirm that BeeWare is able
to produce apps with dynamically loaded binary modules that the iOS App
Store will accept through their review process. In the process of
resolving this limitation, we've started developing a Forge for mobile
packages, significantly improving the tooling for building binary wheels
for iOS.</p>
<h2>Q4 priorities</h2>
<p>Our Q4 goals are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Finalize Toga's test suite</strong>. For real this time - we'll have 100%
branch coverage on every line of Toga's core, and on the macOS,
Windows, GTK, Android and iOS backends. Once we've released a version
of Toga that includes all these fixes, we'll be able to publish a plan
for the road to 1.0.</li>
<li><strong>Python 3.12 support</strong>. We're expecting Python 3.12.0 to drop any
day. We've already done some preliminary work on Python 3.12 support,
but we'll need to finalise that work once the final release is
available.</li>
<li><strong>Start upstreaming iOS and Android support to CPython</strong>. This
quarter, we'll begin the process of upstreaming the patches for iOS
and Android support that we've been maintaining to CPython core, and
developing the CI infrastructure to run CPython's full test suite on
iOS and Android. The eventual goal is for iOS and Android to be Tier 3
supported platforms in Python 3.13. This will take a while to
finalise, but we've got around 8 months until the feature freeze for
Python 3.13, so we're confident we can make this happen. We're
attending the CPython Core Team sprint this month to kick start this
effort.</li>
<li><strong>OptionContainer widget for iOS and Android</strong>. One of the big gaps
identified during the Toga audit was the lack of content navigation
widgets on iOS and Android. This quarter, we're going to start
addressing this gap, adding an OptionContainer widget. This widget
already exists for macOS, GTK and Windows, so we have an API design -
we just need to find a way to make this API work on mobile platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Image Capture</strong>. We're finally going to start addressing device
hardware capabilities. We're going to start with image capture - the
ability to select an image from either the photo library, or take an
image with the camera, and have that image available to Python code.
As well as implementing this API, we're going to need to tackle
permission handling in Briefcase so that apps can declare that they
need access to the camera in a cross-platform way.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Longer term goals</h2>
<p>Over the last 18 months, a major focus has been ensuring that the tools
we have are stable, tested, and fit for purpose. Looking forward, we'll
be able to build on this foundation, adding more widgets (especially for
app content navigation), and filling out notable gaps in widget platform
support (such as Tree and Table widgets on mobile). We'll also start
building out hardware support APIs (such as geolocation and
accelerometers).</p>
<p>However, in addition to adding new features, we're going to start
drawing attention to the features we already have. The Toga audit has
enabled us to revise our API documentation, but API documentation is
only a small part of the overall documentation story. Now that we have a
stable base to work with, we're going to start improving our tutorials
and HowTo documentation, lowering the barrier to entry for new
developers.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Toga and Briefcase are more stable than ever, and we've addressed all
the major technical challenges that existed when full-time work on
BeeWare started early last year. Now we can begin the work of building
on the foundation that we've established, ensuring that everyone in the
Python community can build native applications for their devices.</p>

on
 30 September 2023
  </p>
  
  <p>September has been a month of slow, but significant progress.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul>
<li>We've resolved the issues around the iOS App Store rejecting BeeWare
apps - and, by way of proof, we've updated our demo app, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/au/app/travel-tips/id1336372310#?platform=iphone">Travel
Tips</a>.
We've also updated the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.keith_magee.traveltips">Android version of the
app</a>.</li>
<li>We've completely reworked the tooling for building binary packages for
iOS. <a href="https://github.com/beeware/mobile-forge">Mobile Forge</a> is our
new project for maintaining iOS binary builds. It provides a much more
robust environment for performing cross-compilation, making use of
<a href="https://github.com/benfogle/crossenv">crossenv</a>, rather than bespoke
site package overrides. Getting crossenv working has also required us
to do a deep audit of the various ways that Python reflects describes
the platform it is running on, from the obvious ones like the
<code>platform</code> and <code>sys</code> modules, down to <code>sysconfig</code> and the tags that
are used by <code>pip</code> to determine wheel compatibility.</li>
<li>We've completed an <a href="https://github.com/beeware/Python-Apple-support">initial port of the iOS patches to Python
3.12.0rc3</a>. We're
still hunting some edge cases, but initial signs are promising that
we'll be in a position to do a near "zero day" release of Python 3.12
support for iOS.</li>
<li>For Android, we've re-enabled <a href="https://github.com/chaquo/chaquopy/pull/937">Fortran
support</a> in the package
build system, and used it to <a href="https://github.com/chaquo/chaquopy/pull/949">upgrade
SciPy</a>.</li>
<li>We were anticipating that would would complete the Toga Audit this
month; however, that unfortunately hasn't happened. We've hit a bunch
of complications with getting fonts and canvas support working on
Windows and Android, and the process of getting those platforms
working has revealed some inconsistencies in macOS, iOS and GTK font
handling. However, we have completed the audit of
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2019">DetailedList</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1903">Font</a>, and the audit of
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2029">Canvas</a> is <em>almost</em>
complete.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2112">decoupled the Winforms event loop from the main form in a Toga
app</a>. This doesn't have any
immediate impact on existing Toga apps - but it means we're now in a
position to have windowless apps, such as system tray apps.</li>
<li>We completed the <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1290">fixes needed to support Briefcase on Python
3.12</a>.</li>
<li>We made some <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1425">significant improvements to subprocess encoding
handling</a>. This should
significantly improve the user experience of Windows users, and users
from non-English speaking countries.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1449">formally downgraded our support for AppImage to "Best
effort"</a>. AppImage has
proven increasingly difficult to work with as a format; now that we
have native system packages and Flatpak as options, the effort needed
to maintain AppImage support is better spent elsewhere. We'll still
merge fixes to AppImage support if a PR is provided, but we're no
longer actively fixing bugs, or running AppImage configurations in CI.</li>
<li>We added <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1468">filters to Xcode output to hide ignorable
warnings</a>. Xcode
builds have always been a little noisy; the new Xcode 15 release added
even more noise. The filter means that these warnings will no longer
distract from successful build output.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, we didn't complete the Toga audit in September as we
anticipated. As mentioned, we hit a number of complications and
inconsistencies in font handling, especially in the Canvas widget, which
slowed progress. We'll keep working on this audit in October; and once
we're done, we'll make a release a new version of Toga. This release
will include a number of backwards-incompatible changes identified as
part of the audit, so be prepared for a bumpier-than-usual upgrade
process.</p>
<p>Once the audit is complete, we'll also be looking at a technical
limitation that the widget audit has revealed on Android. A number of
Toga's Android widgets aren't as fully featured as they could be, due to
the fact that accessing the full API would require subclassing a Java
base class. This is an area where Chaquopy has some limitations; so
we're going to try and address these limitations.</p>
<p>We'll also begin the work of upstreaming patches to CPython core. We've
been invited to attend the CPython Core Team Sprint this month, which
will be great opportunity to lay out the roadmap for formal iOS and
Android support in CPython 3.13. This will also involve working on
improving the CI infrastructure for building Android and iOS packages.</p>

  </p>
  
  <p>August has seen an important milestone reached in our Toga work, and
some exciting new features.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul>
<li>We attended <a href="http://2023.pycon.org.au">PyCon AU 2023</a>, and presented a
new talk about the fundamentals of building GUI apps in Python; the
video of this presentation is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DH6rkImiZtc">already
online</a>. At the sprints,
8 new contributors earned their challenge coins, for a range of small
and large fixes.</li>
<li>The Toga Audit is complete on macOS, iOS and GTK! The last pieces were
the audit of <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2058">Window</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2075">App</a>; with those PRs (and
some others that are outstanding), we have 100% code coverage for
Toga's codebase. Windows and Android are catching up rapidly - we've
completed the audit of
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1996">OptionContainer</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2011">Table</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2017">Tree</a>, as well as a major
revamp of <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2020">how layouts are
calculated</a>, which ensures
that minimum window sizes are enforced, and layouts on High DPI
displays are correct.</li>
<li>We added a <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2065">Textual backend for
Toga</a>. This means the same
Toga application will now run on 3 desktop platforms, 2 mobile
platforms, as a single page web app, and in a terminal window. As with
the web backend, there's still a lot of work to fill out all the
widgets, but we've got enough in place to run the BeeWare tutorial app
and the first 2 Toga tutorial steps.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1360">improved the architecture and word size checks that Briefcase
performs when building
apps</a>. This
effectively adds support for 32-bit x86 and ARM platforms; we're
limited in our ability to perform automatic tests to verify these
platforms work as advertised, and upstream tooling isn't always up to
the task (for example, Linuxdeploy doesn't support ARM at any word
size) - but Briefcase now performs much more robust checks, and will
make a best effort when support <em>should</em> exist.</li>
<li>We added <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1417">support for openSUSE (and other SUSE-derived
distributions)</a> to
Briefcase.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1397">updated the version of the Android command line tools that
Briefcase uses</a>.</li>
<li>We resolved a long standing issue with the use of <a href="https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/pull/357">Objective C blocks
on M1 hardware</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>Based on current progress, it seems highly likely that the Toga audit
will be complete on Windows and Android by the end of September. This
will bring the Toga audit to completion, providing a very stable
foundation for future work on Toga. It also means you can expect a new
Toga release in the coming month, incorporating the myriad bug fixes and
improvements that the audit has revealed. This release will include a
number of backwards-incompatible changes identified as part of the
audit, so be prepared for a bumpier-than-usual upgrade process.</p>
<p>So - what comes after the audit? Firstly, we'll be looking into iOS App
Store submission - we've been made aware that although Briefcase apps
work fine on both device and simulator, the App Store has been rejecting
apps because of an internal layout issue. We have already begun work on
this, and thanks to a contribution from the community, we have a very
strong foundation for this work. We'll also start looking at Python 3.12
support, and making preparations for upstreaming our iOS patches into
CPython core.</p>
<p>We'll also be looking at a technical limitation that the widget audit
has revealed on Android. A number of Toga's Android widgets aren't as
fully featured as they could be, due to the fact that accessing the full
API would require subclassing a Java base class. This is an area where
Chaquopy has some limitations; so we're going to try and address these
limitations.</p>

  </p>
  
  <p>The year rolls on, and so does progress on BeeWare!</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul>
<li>We attended <a href="http://europython.eu">EuroPython 2023</a>, presenting on
Briefcase, attending the WASM summit, and running a very successful 2
day sprint.</li>
<li>We've completed the audit of all Toga widgets on macOS, iOS and GTK!
We've also completed the audit of
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1969">ScrollContainer</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1984">SplitContainer</a> on Windows
and Android.</li>
<li>We've added support for <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1331">Docker Desktop and rootless Docker on
Linux</a>.</li>
<li>We've added the ability to get <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1389">detailed logs from the tools used by
Briefcase to build
apps</a>.</li>
<li>We've corrected some <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1375">warnings generated by pip when installing Python
packages on Linux</a>.</li>
<li>We've added support for <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1377">generating APKs as an output format for
Android</a>.</li>
<li>We've improved error reporting when <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1378">an application can't start on
Android due to the device being too
old</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1356">the Android
device clock isn't in sync with the developer's
laptop</a>.</li>
<li>We added <code>__repr__</code> and <code>__str__</code> implementations for Objective C
structures like <a href="https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/pull/340">NSRect, NSRange, NSPoint and
more</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2027">formally dropped support for Python 3.7 in
Toga</a>.</li>
<li>We improved error handling when <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2047">an app doesn't define a main window
as part of it's startup</a>.</li>
<li>Type annotations in Toga <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2044">have been significantly
improved</a>. We've been
adding type annotations as part of the widget audit, but some types
(such as callbacks) weren't as specific as they could have been. We're
now using Protocols to define some of the more complex types in Toga.</li>
<li>We added an
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2050">ActivityIndicator</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2051">Divider</a> widget
implementation in the Web backend.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>The widget testing audit is now complete on macOS, iOS and GTK. An audit
of App and Window functionality is all that stands in the way of 100%
test coverage on those three platforms; it seems likely we'll get there
by the end of this month. Android and Windows coverage is close behind,
but might take a little longer.</p>
<p>Part of the reason for this delay is that we need to address an
important change in the most recent release of Android Studio. Over the
last few years, the Android ecosystem has been in the process of
migrating its build system from Groovy to Kotlin; Android Studio Giraffe
makes Kotlin the default for new projects, so we need to make sure we're
compatible with that change. The widget audit has also highlighted that
we need to improve our handling of subclass inheritance in Java; we're
hoping to make some changes that will enable us to fill in a few more
gaps in widget API coverage on Android.</p>
<p>We'll also be at <a href="https://2023.pycon.org.au">PyCon AU 2023</a> from August
18-22. We're presenting on Saturday; and we'll be there for the full
duration of the sprints. See you in Tarntanya/Adelaide!</p>

  <h2><a href="/cs_CZ/news/buzz/2023q3-roadmap/">2023Q3 Roadmap</a></h2>
  <p class="meta">

  </p>
  
  <p>2023 is halfway done, and BeeWare continues to make steady progress. As
always, this roadmap should be read as a guide to what we aim to focus
on over the coming quarter, rather than a hard commitment of features
that will be made available on a specific deadline.</p>
<h2>Q2 progress</h2>
<p>As with Q1, our focus in Q2 was on Toga testing. This has been a mammoth
project; but it's finally nearing completion. All but 2 widgets (Canvas
and DetailedList) have 100% branch coverage on macOS, iOS and GTK, while
Android and Windows are only 5 more widgets behind (ScrollContainer,
SplitContainer, OptionContainer, Table and Tree). Along the way, we've
identified and resolved lots of inconsistencies in widget APIs, and
resolved countless bugs. We've also fully documented every widget,
ported the test suite to Pytest, and added type annotations in the code
(mostly for documentation purposes, rather than formal validation).
We've also completed testing and coverage of a lot of the non-widget
functionality that wasn’t strictly planned for this quarter - features
like Images, Icons, Validators, application paths, and colors; plus a
lot of tests (and bugfixes) in the core widget layout. We've also got
the start of some tooling that can be used to test the Web backend.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we haven't been able to do any substantial Toga planning.
Once Toga's code is at 100% testing coverage, we'll be in a much better
place to develop those plans. We also haven't been able to add any
native cross-platform hardware support.</p>
<h2>Q3 priorities</h2>
<p>Our Q3 goals are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Finalize Toga's test suite</strong>. By the end of Q3, we should have 100%
branch coverage on every line of Toga's core, and on the macOS,
Windows, GTK, Android and iOS backends.</li>
<li><strong>iOS Binary packaging</strong> We've been made aware that Apple is rejecting
Briefcase packaged iOS apps from the iOS App Store because of a
package layout issue associated with binary modules. This is a very
high priority to fix.</li>
<li><strong>Kotlin upgrades</strong> The upcoming Android Studio release is switching
to Kotlin as its preferred language for new Gradle configuration
files; we need to upgrade Chaquopy's tooling to support this.</li>
<li><strong>Add full support for Java inheritance</strong> In the process of building
Toga's test suite, it's become clear that a number of features can
only be implemented by subclassing Java base classes. Chaquopy's
ability to subclass is currently limited; to unlock all the features
of Android, we need to resolve this limitation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Longer term goals</h2>
<p>Our longer term goals are also <a href="/cs_CZ/news/buzz/2022q4-roadmap">largely unchanged</a>.
Toga 1.0 remains an important goal; once we're at 100% test coverage, we
will be in much better place to provide estimates about Toga 1.0.
Upstreaming is an area where we have some good news - as a result of
discussions at Pycon US, we've received support for raising iOS and
Android to the status of Tier 3 supported platforms in CPython, with the
initial goal of having this in place for Python 3.13. You should expect
to see movement on upstreaming towards the end of this year, and early
next year. A forge for mobile packages is also remains an important
goal; the completion of upstreaming work will make the goal of building
a forge much more viable.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>At the end of Q2 2023, Toga's testing journey is nearing completion...
but there's still lots of work to be done. However, the groundwork that
we've been doing over the last 6 months has put us in a very strong
position to develop Toga and the rest of the BeeWare ecosystem going
forward.</p>
