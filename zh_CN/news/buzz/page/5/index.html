    于 1 February 2023 发布
  </p>
  
  <p>BeeWare has had an exciting start to the new year, with a couple of
significant releases</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<p>We had two big releases in January.</p>
<p>Firstly, we released Briefcase 0.3.12. This is the first Briefcase
release in 3 months, so it includes a lot of improvements, but the most
notable improvements are the new "Testing mode", a major improvement to
the Android build process, and a huge number of bug fixes and
improvements - especially on Windows.</p>
<p>Secondly - and more importantly - we released Toga 0.3.0! No more dev
releases or <code>--pre</code> flags for <code>pip</code> - the stable release of Toga on PyPI
is now closely tracking actual development. It's been over 5 years since
we last released an official stable Toga version, even though we've been
recommending the dev releases for most of that time. However, as a
result of a number of changes that landed this month, we're finally
committing to the 0.3.0 branch properly.</p>
<p>These releases incorporate changes going back months (and years); but we
made some very specific progress during January:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chaquopy <a href="https://chaquo.com/chaquopy/chaquopy-version-14-0-2/">had a new
release.</a>,
significantly improving build times on Android, improving the
rendering of <code>stdout</code> content in the Android logs, adding some
features that make it easier to expose the original project source
code in the running app bundle, and enabling PEP517 builds of project
dependencies.</li>
<li>Briefcase is now able to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1058">reference local source packages when
building Linux AppImage
binaries</a>.</li>
<li>Some errors caused by the way the Windows Store version of Python
handles local application data <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1054">have been
corrected</a>.</li>
<li>Briefcase's help text now <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1005">shows the list of platforms and output
formats</a>, rather than
requiring an additional help call to retrieve that information.</li>
<li>Some issues with thread and asyncio safety in Rubicon ObjC were
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/pull/246">identified and
resolved</a>, along
with an issue associated with the way some Objective C classes (such
as NSWindow) are <a href="https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/pull/258">renamed at
runtime</a>.</li>
<li>Initial GUI testing backends for
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1707">macOS</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1749">iOS</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1755">GTK</a> were added.</li>
<li>A long standing issue with the <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/1439">replacement of root window
content</a> on GTK and iOS
has been resolved.</li>
<li>Coverage testing was <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1747">added to the Toga Android GUI test
backend</a>.</li>
<li>An API was added to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1728">allow scrolling MultilineTextInput
widgets</a> to the top and
bottom of the widget content.</li>
<li>The work <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1675">moving Toga to use
Setuptools-SCM</a> was
completed. Development versions of Toga will now report a specific
version control commit; release versions have their version determined
by the git tag used to produce the release.</li>
<li>We completed a major review of the way we're using GitHub issue
labels, and modified those labels to be consistent across all
repositories.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>Much of the last 3 months have been spent getting a GUI testing
framework in place for Toga. That work is now in place, so now we'll be
working full time on writing GUI tests for Toga, with the aim of getting
Toga to 100% coverage. Along the way, we'll discover all the edge cases,
bugs, and partially missing implementations that are lurking in the
individual Toga widgets.</p>
<h2>Want to get involved?</h2>
<p>Want to get involved? Here are some open issues that would be a great
place to get started with contributing to a BeeWare project. They're all
relatively minor changes, but would provide a big improvement to the
lives of BeeWare users:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/865">Modify the handling of app signing
options</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/780">Filter out a message generated after Xcode
updates</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/856">Add the ability to refresh the support package in a
project</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/853">Provide protection against creating projects with "semi-reserved"
names</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/808">Add the ability to configure the ABIs built by an Android
project</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/463">Add support for the ANDROID_HOME environment
variable</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/986">Purge cache folders when installing app code in
Briefcase</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1053">Add a template branch option when creating a new
project</a></li>

  <h2><a href="/zh_CN/news/buzz/2023q1-roadmap/">2023Q1 Roadmap</a></h2>
  <p class="meta">
    由
    
      <a href="https://cloudisland.nz/@freakboy3742">Russell Keith-Magee</a>
    
    于 11 January 2023 发布
  </p>
  
  <p>Welcome to a new year! 2022 saw some amazing progress for BeeWare; and
we've got some big plans for 2023. As always, this roadmap should be
read as a guide to what we aim to focus on over the coming quarter,
rather than a hard commitment of features that will be made available on
a specific deadline.</p>
<h2>Q4 progress</h2>
<p>Progress in Q4 was not as significant as we originally planned. A
combination of conference travel and holiday leave meant the quarter was
shorter than most; but even then, our goals for the quarter were
extremely optimistic.</p>
<p>We were able to hit our goal for <strong>Web deployment</strong>. We've restored the
Toga web backend to a working state, and we've added a Web deployment
backend to Briefcase. There's still a lot of work required before Web
deployment is a viable as a production solution, but the initial pieces
are now in place.</p>
<p>We were also able to hit our goals on <strong>housekeeping</strong>. We've made a lot
of improvements to the base infrastructure of repositories, enabling
Black, pre-commit, and towncrier in Toga, and improving coverage
reporting (including getting to 100% branch coverage in Briefcase's test
suite).</p>
<p>We've made significant progress on improving the <strong>testing</strong> story for
BeeWare apps. We've added the ability for Briefcase projects to run
normal Python test suites inside a packaged app, and we've demonstrated
that we can use this capability to run CI for iOS and Android apps (as
well as desktop platforms). This feature will be included in the next
Briefcase release.</p>
<p>Using this new testing capability, we've started building a GUI test
suite for Toga. This is a critical part of ensuring the quality of Toga
going forward; but getting this testing framework in place has revealed
lots of complications and bugs. We're making progress, but there's still
a lot of work to be done.</p>
<p>Our plans to release Toga v0.3 final have also been delayed. The process
of adding SCM-based versioning to the repository (part of the
housekeeping task) revealed a bug that prevented code running on
Android; fixing that bug became a blocker on the release of Toga v0.3.
We've now resolved that problem, so we should be able to release Toga
v0.3 final as soon as the fix has been released into the BeeWare's
Android tooling.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that leaves a lot on the Q4 TODO list. We haven't made
any changes to the example apps; Toga documentation is mostly unchanged;
we haven't been able to do any substantial Toga planning; and we haven't
been able to add any native cross-platform hardware support.</p>
<h2>Q1 priorities</h2>
<p>It's probably unsurprising that Q1 2023 will be picking up on items we
didn't get around to in Q4 2022.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Testing</strong> - Completing the Toga GUI testing suite will be our
primary focus for the quarter.</li>
<li><strong>Planning</strong> - Once we've got the test harness in place, we'll be in a
much better position to evaluate what work remains to get to v1.0.</li>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong> - The process of systematically building a test
suite also gives us an opportunity to update the API documentation for
each widget as we go. There's still lots of documentation required on
top of the API guide, but complete API documentation will be a big
start.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-platform hardware</strong> - Cross-platform support for device
hardware (especially mobile) is one of the banner features that makes
mobile device support worthwhile. Providing proof that this hardware
support is easy to use will be a key demonstrator for BeeWare as a
platform.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Longer term goals</h2>
<p>Our longer term goals are largely <a href="/zh_CN/news/buzz/2022q4-roadmap">unchanged from Q4
2022</a>. Upstreaming, Toga 1.0, and a forge for mobile
packages are all important goals for the BeeWare ecosystem. However, we
don't expect to make any significant progress on these goals until we
have solidified Toga's testing story.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The seeming lack of progress made in Q4 was definitely disappointing;
but the work hasn't been wasted. Progress has been slow specifically
because the problems we're trying to solve are hard, and reveal every
gnarled edge case that platforms have to offer. We <em>are</em> making
progress, though; and once we've got the Toga testing framework
stabilized, we'll be in a much stronger position to make predictions for
future work on Toga.</p>



  
  
  <h2><a href="/zh_CN/news/buzz/december-2022-status-update/">December 2022 Status Update</a></h2>

      <a href="https://cloudisland.nz/@freakboy3742">Russell Keith-Magee</a>
    
    于 17 December 2022 发布
  </p>
  
  <p>This status update is a little earlier than our usual end-of-month
report because the team will be taking a well-earned break to spend time
with family and friends over the holiday and new year period. As a
result, we've got less to report than in past months; however, some
significant progress and improvements have been made.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<p>During December:</p>
<ul>
<li>We continued to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1002">fine tune Briefcase's recently added test
mode</a>. This reflects
issues that have been discovered as we continue to build Toga's GUI
test suite.</li>
<li>We updated Briefcase's Web backend to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1006">support changes made in the
2022.12.1 release of
PyScript</a>.</li>
<li>We fixed a <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/993">bug preventing the use of local file references in
requirements when building Linux
AppImages</a>. As a side
effect, this change also makes it much easier to get a debug session
inside the Docker container used to build AppImages.</li>
<li>We merged the <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1687">first draft of the Toga GUI
testbed</a>. There is still a
lot of work to be done on this testbed, but it provides a solid
foundation on which we can build tests of Toga's cross-platform GUI
behavior.</li>
<li>We added support for <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1710">mouse events on the Canvas on
GTK</a>.</li>
<li>We corrected a bug on Windows where local date formats would cause the
DateInput widget to crash.</li>
<li>We fixed <a href="https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/pull/238">a bug in Rubicon that would cause background threads to
stall on iOS</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>There won't be much more progress from the core team for the rest of
this year. We'll still be around to handle critical problems, answer
questions and do code reviews for contributors; but our response times
might be a little slower than normal. We'll publish our Q1 2023 roadmap
when we return in January - but we'll be largely picking up where this
year has left off - improving the testing story for Toga.</p>
<h2>Want to get involved?</h2>

  <h2><a href="/zh_CN/news/buzz/november-2022-status-update/">November 2022 Status Update</a></h2>
  <p class="meta">
    由
    
      <a href="https://cloudisland.nz/@freakboy3742">Russell Keith-Magee</a>
    
    于 1 December 2022 发布
  </p>
  
  <p>November has brought some very important improvements to BeeWare.
Although these changes don't have an immediate impact for users, they're
going to form a vital part of our work going forward.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<p>During November:</p>
<ul>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/962">added a test mode to
Briefcase</a>. This is a
<em>huge</em> step forward, as it means we are now able to run automated
tests for iOS and Android, as well as validation tests for packaged
app behaviors. As a proof of concept, we've already begun porting our
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/Python-support-testbed/pull/6">support package validation
app</a> - this
is an app that we've historically needed to run manually.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/954">added the ability for an AppImage to customise the Dockerfile used
to build the project</a>.
This was required to support the use of Rust-based dependencies (such
as <a href="https://cryptography.io/">cryptography</a>) in AppImages; however,
the approach we've taken should allow for any other customisation that
may be required, without the need to maintain a fork of the AppImage
project template.</li>
<li>We've <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/974">added the ability for users to add customisations to the
Android Gradle file for their
projects</a>. As with the
Dockerfile changes, this allows for small customisations without the
need to use a completely forked template.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/956">improved the resilience of Briefcase on flaky network
connections</a>.
Previously, an interrupted download of a support package could leave
Briefcase in a broken state; this should no longer be possible.</li>
<li>We've <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/964">improved type hinting in the Briefcase
codebase</a>, especially
relating to the ToolCache class.</li>
<li>We've <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/966">improved the handling of Android apps that fail immediately on
app startup</a>.
Previously, if your app crashed due to something like a Python syntax
error, it was possible for Briefcase to hang in a way that made it
look like the issue was due to Briefcase being unable to start the
app, rather than a user code problem.</li>
<li>We've <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/970">corrected a problem on Windows that was preventing app output
from being captured in the Briefcase
log</a>.</li>
<li>We completed the process of modernising the layout and tooling of the
Toga repository, including the <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1639">introduction of
Black</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1638">Towncrier</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1675">setuptools_scm</a>, and a
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1669">large reorganisation of the code
structure</a></li>
<li>We've <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1687">begun building the first automated test of Toga's GUI
behavior</a>. This is still in
the early stages, but it will form the a core part of our testing
infrastructure in the near future.</li>
<li>We've added preliminary support for Python 3.12 to
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/965">Briefcase</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1677">Toga</a> and <a href="https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/pull/231">Rubicon
ObjC</a>.</li>
<li>We've <a href="https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/pull/230">updated the codebase of Rubicon-ObjC to use

<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>December will be a slow month due to the Christmas and New Year break;
however, until then, we'll continue to focus will continue to be on
testing. We'll continue to build out the testing tools that we've worked
on this month, and start building tests using those tools. We also hope
to begin work on a firm 1.0 roadmap for Toga.</p>

  </p>
  
  <p>How time flies! Progress in October was a little slower than in past
months; preparing for and attending DjangoCon US, plus some well-earned
holiday leave reduced the amount of time we had to work on new features.
However, we were able to make a number of significant improvements.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<p>During October:</p>
<ul>
<li>We restored the <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1475">web backend for
Toga</a>! Web deployment has
always been part of the BeeWare story, but we hit some technological
challenges with the approach that we were taking in the Toga 0.2
branch. However, with the addition of WASM as an officially supported
platform in CPython 3.11, and the release of PyScript, we have a new
way of getting Python in the browser. We have been able to use these
tools to build a much improved Toga web backend.</li>
<li>We added support for <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/898">deploying Briefcase apps as static web
sites</a>.</li>
<li>We released official support for Python 3.11 on macOS, iOS and Linux -
on the day that Python 3.11 was released!. Python 3.11 support for
Android and Windows is ready to go, and should be published in a day
or two.</li>
<li>We modified Briefcase to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/911">write its logs into
subdirectory</a>, instead
of littering them in the project directory.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://2022.djangocon.us/talks/how-to-turn-your-website-into-an-app-and/">presented a talk at DjangoCon US
2022</a>.
The video for this talk should be up in around a month. A major
feature of this talk was a demo of an Electron-style "web site as an
app", built entirely in Python. This demo (called Positron) has been
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1612">included in the Toga repository as an
example</a>.</li>
<li>We attended the DjangoCon US 2022 sprints, and handed out 4 <a href="https://beeware.org/contributing/challenge-coins/">challenge
coins</a> to new
contributors!</li>
<li>We added the ability to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1599">retrieve widgets by
ID</a> to the Toga API.</li>
<li>We made a big change to the way that <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1534">Toga backends are
discovered</a>. This new
approach has two major advantages - firstly, it means third-parties
can register their own backends; but more importantly, it means that
code no longer needs to explicitly provide a backend. This simplifies
the creation of test cases - but it also means that icons, images and
fonts no longer need to be "late bound". This is an internal detail,
but it significantly simplifies the code using those data types.</li>
<li>We added the ability to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1588">create Image objects from raw
data</a>, rather than an image
file.</li>
<li>We started the process of modernising the layout and tooling of the
Toga repository. Some of these changes have already landed; more will
come in the coming days. This ensures that we have a stable foundation
for future work on Toga.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>During November, we continuing to focus on Toga, with a particular focus
on testing. A particular focus will be working out how to test graphical
features of Toga - an area that has historically been managed entirely
with manual testing. Having strong automated testing of graphical
features will be a key milestone in ensuring Toga remains stable in the
long term.</p>

  <h2><a href="/zh_CN/news/buzz/2022q4-roadmap/">2022Q4 Roadmap</a></h2>
  <p class="meta">
    由
    
      <a href="https://cloudisland.nz/@freakboy3742">Russell Keith-Magee</a>
    
    于 4 October 2022 发布
  </p>
  
  <p>With Q3 completed, it's time to provide an update on the long term goals
and priorities of the BeeWare project. As always, this roadmap should be
read as a guide to what we aim to focus on over the coming quarter,
rather than a hard commitment of features that will be made available on
a specific deadline.</p>
<h2>Q3 progress</h2>
<p>We were able to hit our biggest Q3 goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Linux packaging</strong> - We've investigated and addressed all the known
issues with Linux packaging. There's <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/886">one pending
enhancement</a> that
would expand the range of third-party binary packages that can be
included in Briefcase projects.</li>
<li><strong>Windows packaging</strong> - We've introduced a stub binary for Windows
apps (as well as a Visual Studio target for Windows projects). This
allowed us to significantly improve log capture, so when a Windows app
crashes it's a lot easier to obtain diagnostic information. This
change also corrected <em>most</em> of the issues with the way Windows apps
were using the site module; however, there is still <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/381">one issue related
to the handling of packages that have complex post-installation
processes</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Binary modules</strong> - By far the biggest achievement of Q3. With the
release of Briefcase 0.3.10, we now support binary modules on iOS and
Android. We have also published 40 of the most popular binary modules,
compiled for iOS and Android.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, we didn't hit all our goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Testing</strong> - Testing support has improved substantially. We have a
much more thorough CI configuration on Briefcase that verifies that
templates generate valid projects. We also have <a href="https://github.com/beeware/Python-support-testbed">a testbed
project</a> that we
can use to check that support packages are behaving correctly.
However, we are not yet able to run this test project in CI, so we
don't have automated validation of PRs against the support packages.
We also made very little progress in GUI testing.</li>
<li><strong>Conda integration</strong> - We began initial discussions around Conda
integration, on two fronts: firstly, to investigate the possibility of
using Conda as a base for package management in apps; and secondly,
about using conda-forge as a framework for managing community
contributions. Both of these conversations are ongoing; it will likely
take some time before these efforts bear fruit.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Q4 priorities</h2>
<p>In Q4, we're planning to focus on:</p>
<h3>Toga</h3>
<p>The primary focus for Q4 will be Toga. There are a number of pieces of
work involved with this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Housekeeping</strong> - Basic repository maintenance tasks, like enabling
<span class="title-ref">black</span>, introducing pre-commit hooks,
towncrier, and automating release infrastructure.</li>
<li><strong>Example consolidation</strong> - Toga's examples folder has become a
sprawling collection of code that is part documentation, part testbed.
We need to start consolidating these examples into 2 apps - one that
is a user-facing demonstrator of Toga features, and one that can be
used as a functional test of Toga features.</li>
<li><strong>Testing</strong> - Modernising and cleaning up the existing test suite, and
working out how to automate GUI tests</li>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong> - Toga's documentation has lagged behind an
acceptable standard for a long time,</li>
<li><strong>Planning</strong> - Developing a clear plan for what will be in Toga 1.0</li>
<li><strong>Cross-platform hardware</strong> - While it has always been <em>technically</em>
possible to support the APIs needed to access device hardware, there
hasn't been a cross-platform API for this work. In Q4, we hope to
demonstrate at least 1 interesting piece of mobile device hardware.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although we won't get to Toga v1.0 in Q4, we <em>will</em> land a v0.3 final,
after several years of maintaining dev pre-releases as the main way to
use Toga.</p>
<h3>Web support</h3>
<p>Toga has historically had support for the Web as a platform; however,
that effort was put on hold because the approach we were taking wasn't
proving viable. However, with the release of Python 3.11, WASM becomes
an officially supported CPython platform. We've also seen the release of
<a href="https://pyscript.net">PyScript</a>, demonstrating that client-side Python
in the browser is an extremely viable proposition. The time has come to
resurrect BeeWare's support for the web as a deployment platform. This
will involve getting Toga's web backend into a working state, and adding
a web deployment backend for Briefcase.</p>
<h2>Longer term goals</h2>
<p>Looking into next year, the big items on the horizon are:</p>
<h3>Upstreaming</h3>
<p>With binary modules now being supported on both iOS and Android, and the
introduction of a <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0011/">Tier 3 support level in
PEP11</a>, the prospect of elevating iOS
and Android to official supported platforms is seeming increasingly
plausible. Our hope is to go to PyCon US next year in a position to make
a concrete proposal to the CPython core team.</p>
<h3>Toga 1.0</h3>
<p>The broad goal for "Toga 1.0" could be considered "Tkinter, but with
some additional bells to show off". We want to deliver a core widget set
of the "essentials", plus some nice features to show off, like WebViews
and camera or GPS integration. We hope to establish the feature list for
Toga 1.0 in Q4; once that plan is in place, we'll have a better idea of
when we will be able to deliver on that plan.</p>
<h3>A Forge for mobile packages</h3>
<p>As of today, all binary modules for mobile platforms are being
maintained by the BeeWare team. This isn't a viable solution long term;
we need to move to an environment where the community can manage binary
packages for mobile platforms.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>For the last 6 months, the focus of BeeWare has been on Briefcase and
the support packages - ensuring that we have a feature complete, robust
set of tools for deploying apps on any platform. In Q4, our focus is
shifting to the tools we need to build apps <em>on</em> those platforms, and
ensuring we have a stable foundation for future development. It's taken
a long time for BeeWare to get this far - but we're getting very close
to unlocking the remarkable potential of the Python ecosystem on mobile
devices.</p>



  
  
  <h2><a href="/zh_CN/news/buzz/september-2022-status-update/">September 2022 Status Update</a></h2>
  <p class="meta">
    由
    
      <a href="https://cloudisland.nz/@freakboy3742">Russell Keith-Magee</a>
    
    于 3 October 2022 发布
  </p>
  
  <p>September has been a big month for the BeeWare team. There have been
lots of small updates - but there's one very large, eagerly anticipated
update that has taken several months to complete.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<p>During September:</p>
<ul>
<li>We added support for binary packages on mobile platforms! There's more
detail related to this than can fit in a bullet point; more details
below.</li>
<li>We added the ability to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/854">remove files from a templated
app</a>. This can be used
to trim down a project, removing parts of the Python interpreter that
you don't need (such as standard library modules that you don't need)</li>
<li>We've changed the way we use templates, switching to using <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/862">branches
based on the Briefcase release, rather than the Python
release</a>. This enables
us to make development changes to templates without affecting the
published stable release.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/801">reworked the way Briefcase manages integrations with the tools
needed to build apps</a>.
This was a mammoth project, but as a result the process of verifying
tools is faster, and a number of bugs related to having stale builds
have been resolved.</li>
<li>We've made a number of improvements to console handling of log
messages, especially on Windows</li>
<li>We improved error handling in Toga when <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1589">TLS1.2 or TLS1.3 isn't
supported by Windows</a>.</li>
<li>We started conversations with the teams at Anaconda responsible for
conda about using Conda as a base for Briefcase apps, and on using
Conde-forge style infrastructure to support binary packaging. Nothing
concrete has come from these conversations yet; these conversations
are ongoing.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Binary package support you say?</h3>
<p>All the new binary packaging support is contained in <a href="https://pypi.org/project/briefcase/0.3.10/">Briefcase
0.3.10</a>.</p>
<p>On Android, binary module support was achieved by moving to
<a href="https://chaquo.com">Chaquopy</a> as a base for Android projects. Along
with support for binary modules, this change has the added benefit of
faster startup times, and less bugs at runtime. This means you'll need
to re-generate any Android project - the Python source code should work
as-is, but there's no simple way to convert the Android Gradle project
from the older Rubicon base to the newer Chaquopy base.</p>
<p>On iOS, we've <a href="https://github.com/beeware/Python-Apple-support/pull/161">reworked how the support packages are
constructed</a>,
and <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/849">added support for installing binary modules from a BeeWare-specific
package repository that includes builds of iOS binary
wheels</a>. We've also added
asset signing to the iOS Xcode project - and applied the same changes to
the macOS backends. Of course, this also means you'll need to
re-generate any iOS project to take advantage of these changes.</p>
<p>While we are now able to support binary packages on mobile platforms,
this doesn't mean that <em>every</em> binary package is automatically
supported. Binary wheels need to be compiled for mobile platforms, and
compiling for mobile platforms can be complicated. However, we've
compiled ~40 of them most popular packages with binary components
(including numpy, pandas, cryptography, pillow and matplotlib), and made
them available as dependencies. In order to get working builds, some of
these packages are slightly older versions (e.g., cryptography is a
version from before the introduction of the rust dependency); however,
we've endeavoured to provide the most recent versions possible.</p>
<p>A full list of supported packages can be found <a href="https://chaquo.com/pypi-7.0/">on the Chaquopy package
repository for Android</a>, and the <a href="https://anaconda.org/beeware/repo">BeeWare
repository for iOS</a>. If your project
uses one of these packages, you only need to add them to the
<span class="title-ref">requires</span> definition in your
<span class="title-ref">pyproject.toml</span>, then update and re-build
your project, and you're done.</p>
<p>If there’s a package you want that isn't on this list, you'll need to
request a binary wheel. For Android, <a href="https://github.com/chaquo/chaquopy/issues">open a ticket on the Chaquopy
repository</a>. For iOS, <a href="https://github.com/freakboy3742/chaquopy">open a
ticket on this repository</a>. If
you're adventurous, you can also try building wheels yourself. The issue
trackers are on a project that has as "forge-like" tool for building
wheels, in the <span class="title-ref">server/pypi</span> folder; there
are tools and documentation describing how to build a package. The use
of these projects is a short-term measure; in the longer term, we want
to move to an actual “forge”-style community-managed model for managing
binary packages.</p>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>For the last few months, the focus of the BeeWare team has been on
Briefcase and the support packages. In October (and the rest of Q4),
we'll be shifting our focus to Toga. The initial focus will be on
improving the foundation of the project - testing and build
infrastructure; but once those pieces are in place, we'll start adding
new features.</p>
<p>We'll also be at <a href="https://2022.djangocon.us">DjangoCon US</a> in San
Diego - and there will be some web-related updates related to the
presentation that will be given at that conference. We hope we'll see
you there!</p>

  <h2><a href="/zh_CN/news/buzz/august-2022-status-update/">August 2022 Status Update</a></h2>
  <p class="meta">

  </p>
  
  <p>The main focus of the BeeWare team during August was binary module
support on mobile platforms. Although we haven't got the final results
of this work yet, we have significant progress to report for both iOS
and Android. We've also had a number of other improvements land over the
course of the month.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<p>During August:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have continued to work on the changes needed to migrate Android
support to Chaquopy. This has included some <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase-android-gradle-template/pull/52">major changes to the
Android Gradle
template</a>,
and developing a Rubicon Java compatibility layer. Eventually, Toga
will migrate to use the Chaquopy APIs directly, but in the interim,
the Rubicon APIs will continue to work.</li>
<li>We have started updating Chaquopy to support multiple Python versions.
Historically, Chaquopy has only supported a single Python3 version
(3.8); for compatibility with Briefcase, we are adding support for
Python 3.9 and 3.10, as well as preparing the ground for a 3.11
release when Python 3.11 is finalised.</li>
<li>We have modified the Python Apple support packages to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/Python-Apple-support/pull/161">provide the
binary portions of the Python standard library as dynamically loaded
binary
modules</a>,
and modified the
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase-iOS-Xcode-template/pull/7">iOS</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase-macOS-Xcode-template/pull/10">macOS</a>
templates to use and sign these binary modules. These changes haven't
landed yet, but they have been tested on simulators and physical
devices. Along the way, we've also updated the support packages to use
OpenSSL 3.</li>
<li>We have modified Briefcase to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/805">make the Python support package
optional</a>, at the
discretion of the project template. This was needed because Chaquopy
provides the Python library using a Gradle plugin, rather than
requiring a project to source a pre-compiled support package.</li>
<li>We have addressed an issue with the way Briefcase handles
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/816">requirements references when they are relative file
references</a>. Although
this was added to allow rapid debugging of changes to Toga on Android,
it also affected the recently added Linuxdeploy backend.</li>
<li>We've <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/846">added an "open" subcommand to
Briefcase</a>, making it
easier to open project-based templates in their respective IDEs.</li>
<li>We've <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/821">improved Android log
handling</a>, ensuring
that more app-specific logs are displayed to the user.</li>
<li>We've <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/844">dramatically improved our CI testing of
Briefcase</a>. We now
build an app on every platform we support, using every backend.</li>
<li>We've addressed a number of bugs in the Pack layout algorithm.</li>
<li>We've continued the process of making Toga widget APIs naming
internally consistent.</li>
<li>We've fixed some canvas bugs that were causing problems on Windowns
with our native Matplotlib rendering backend,
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga-chart">toga-chart</a>.</li>
<li>We've addressed some bugs associated with <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1572">changing the main content
of a Toga window</a>.</li>
<li>We added an <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1574">initial implementation of a DetailedList widget on
Windows</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>In September, we hope to wrap up the work on binary dependencies. On
Android, this is mostly a matter of completing the work to support
multiple Python versions. On iOS, we need to develop the tools to manage
the compilation of third-party binary libraries. We have an initial
proof of concept of this; we need to finish these tools, and develop the
infrastructure to distribute. We're also hoping to start conversations
with the Anaconda team about Conda integration with Briefcase, and start
improving GUI testing in Toga.</p>

  <p>Another month of important updates to the BeeWare project! This month,
our focus was on packaging improvements on Linux and Windows.</p>
<p>In addition the technical progress, we welcomed <a href="https://github.com/mhsmith">Malcolm Smith (@mhsmith
on GitHub)</a> to the Anaconda BeeWare team!
Malcolm brings his considerable experience developing and maintaining
<a href="https://github.com/chaquo">Chaquopy</a>, a set of tools and libraries for
building Android applications that use Python. Chaquopy tackles the
"Python on Android" problem from the perspective of adding Python to an
existing Android Studio project rather than writing apps entirely with
Python; as a result, it features much tighter integration with native
Android Studio tooling. One particularly interesting feature of Chaquopy
is that it supports binary dependencies on Android - a key feature that
BeeWare's Android tooling currently lacks. Historically, Chaquopy was a
closed source tool with licenses available for open source projects;
however, as a result of joining Anaconda, Malcolm has <a href="https://chaquo.com/chaquopy/chaquopy-is-now-open-source/">released Chaquopy
as an Open Source
project</a>!</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<p>During July:</p>
<ul>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/756">added support for Linuxdeploy
plugins</a> for Linux
AppImages. These plugins are an important part of making AppImages
self-contained, as many libraries need to provide the Linuxdeploy
tooling hints to help find all the resources needed at runtime. Adding
support for these plugins should address most of the issues we've been
seeing with moving AppImages between Linux versions.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/802">added a Flatpak backend for Linux
packaging</a>. Flatpak is
an alternative packaging format to AppImage which has the support of a
number of large Linux distributions. For now, AppImage continues to be
the default Linux packaging format, but we may change this default in
the future.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/782">improved the packaging of Windows apps by adding a stub
binary</a>. We're still
hunting some bugs in this stub binary, but when those are resolved,
the Windows apps generated by Briefcase will present to the operating
system with consistent app naming and icons. The stub binary also
enables us to catch runtime problems with the app in a way that makes
diagnosing app problems much easier.</li>
<li>We presented a webinar about native application development. If you
weren't able to attend the webinar live, a recording is available;
<a href="https://event.on24.com/wcc/r/3766379/B50F020E006CF935D87609BF3E247ED7?partnerref=anaconda.com">register here to
watch</a>.</li>
<li>We got an initial proof of concept of a Toga app running on Android
using Chaquopy as a base, accessing a binary library (matplotlib),
deployed with Briefcase. Over the coming weeks, we're hoping this
proof of concept will evolve into major improvement to BeeWare's
Android tooling.</li>
<li>We modified Briefcase to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/777">use OS-appropriate directories for
caching</a>. While the
<code>~/.briefcase</code> location has served us well, it isn't a location that
adheres to platform-native conventions for storing app resources, so
we've moved Briefcase's cache of downloads, tools and templates to a
platform-appropriate location.</li>
<li>We addressed an issue with the <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/803">current working directory leaking into
the runtime path</a>. This
was especially common with Linux apps, but it could potentially be an
issue with other platforms as well.</li>
<li>We've started the process of making Toga widget APIs internally
consistent. While we've aimed to keep naming of widgets' attributes
and handlers consistent, there are a couple of annoying
inconsistencies. We've started the process of cleaning up these
inconsistencies.</li>
<li>We've started looking into binary dependencies on iOS apps.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>In August, our major focus will be binary dependencies on mobile. This
is one of the biggest missing pieces of the BeeWare story at present.
Being able to utilize Chaquopy as a base gives us a huge head start on
Android, so it seems likely we'll have a working solution for Android in
the near future. However, on iOS, we're still at the "we don't know what
we don't know" stage. It's unclear if we'll have a fully working
solution by the end of the month, but we should have at least some
progress to report.</p>

  </p>
  
  <p>It's been another busy month at the hive! This month, we've had a couple
of high profile improvements, and some slow progress towards longer term
goals. These improvements have been primarily in Briefcase and app
packaging, but there have been some minor Toga improvements as well.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<p>During June:</p>
<ul>
<li>We significantly improved the UI of Briefcase by <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/740">adding
Rich</a> to implement
terminal output. This allows us to have <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/755">vastly improved progress
bars</a>, as well as the
ability to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/760">save a full debug log when a problem
occurs</a>. These
improvements (and several others) are the result of contributions from
community member <a href="https://github.com/rmartin16">Russell Martin</a> -
thanks Russell!</li>
<li>We added support for <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/757">macOS app
notarization</a>.</li>
<li>We improved the way the <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/766">Briefcase manages Android system
images</a>. This corrects
a bug we were seeing that was causing the Android emulator to be
installed twice, and could lead to situations where emulators could be
discovered, but not started.</li>
<li>We've explored the source of the <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/718">Linux packaging
problems</a> we've been
seeing. We've <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/761">documented a workaround for one of those
problems</a>; and we're
working on 2 fixes (<a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/756">supporting Linuxdeploy
plugins</a> and <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/754">adding
Flatpak support</a>) that
will hopefully address the remaining Linux packaging issues.</li>
<li>We've <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/775">improved Windows MSI
installers</a> so that it
will use the right <span class="title-ref">Program Files</span>
directory, as well as providing an install-time option for system vs
user installs of a package.</li>
<li>We made some small improvements that <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/769">improve support for non-ASCII
project names and
descriptions</a>.</li>
<li>We've made some <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1504">more improvements to Toga
Webviews</a>, ensuring that
the current URL is accessible through the Python API.</li>
<li>We've <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1514">addressed a long standing
bug</a> that would cause Toga
apps to be unable to find their local resource folders, depending on
how the app was invoked. More importantly, this change has been
accompanied by additions to the test suite. This is the start of being
able to test runtime behavior of apps, which will be an increasinging
important feature moving forward.</li>
<li>We've <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1513">added a stack trace dialog for
Windows</a>. A version of this
dialog will be integrated into future improvements in Windows
packaging.</li>
<li>Finally, we published our <a href="https://beeware.org/news/buzz/2022q3-roadmap/">Q3
roadmap</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>In July, we'll be focussing on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Completing the work on Linux and Windows application packaging.</li>
<li>Presenting a webinar about native application development. If you'd
like to attend, <a href="https://event.on24.com/wcc/r/3766379/B50F020E006CF935D87609BF3E247ED7?partnerref=anaconda.com">registration for this webinar is
open</a></li>
<li>Starting investigations into binary module support on mobile
platforms.</li>
</ul>
<p>We're also delighted to announce that we've successfully completed our
hiring process; so, in 2 weeks, there will be another Bee in the hive!
I'm very excited about the possibilities that this additional team
member will afford. Look out for a welcome announcement in the coming
weeks.</p>
