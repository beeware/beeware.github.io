=================


This is the homepage for the `BeeWare project`_.

It is a `Lektor`_-based site.

If you want to contribute a modification, you can fork this repository and
submit a pull request. However, **do not fork the master branch** - fork the
`lektor branch`_ and make changes there instead.

.. _lektor branch: https://github.com/beeware/beeware.github.io/tree/lektor

If you want to test out a change before you submit it, create a virtual 
environment, and install `Lektor`_::

    $ python3 -m venv venv
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    (venv) $ python -m pip install lektor

Then from the root directory of the checkout, run::

    (venv) $ lektor server

.. _Lektor: https://getlektor.com

This will `start a webserver`_ that will autoreload whenever you make a change
to site content.

.. _start a webserver: http://127.0.0.1:5000

Translating
-----------

Want to make BeeWare more accessible to non-English-speakers?  Help translate
the site!  Steps are as follows:

1. Add language specification to `BeeWare.lektorproject
   <https://github.com/beeware/beeware.github.io/blob/lektor/BeeWare.lektorproject>`_.

   Fill out the name of the language, its url prefix, and the locale. Make sure
   you use the correct `ISO 639-1
   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes>`_ locale code - for
   many countries, it's not the same as the national TLD. For example, the ISO
   639-1 Danish locale is 'da', but Denmark uses the '.dk' TLD.

2. Add an entry for your language to the `Atom configuration
   <https://github.com/beeware/beeware.github.io/blob/lektor/configs/atom.ini>`_.

3. Add your first translation, by translating the names for the menus at the
   top of each page. Edit `the menus translation file
   <https://github.com/beeware/beeware.github.io/blob/lektor/databags/menu.ini>`_,
   adding a block for your language.

4. Start adding translations for content pages on the site. Translated files
   are at the same directory level as the primary English files, but have a
   language suffix. For example, Arabic's locale is 'ar', so you would add
   `contents+ar.lr` wherever the original file name is `contents.lr`

A great place to start translating is the `contributing section
<https://beeware.org/contributing/>`_.
