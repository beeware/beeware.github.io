===============

This is the homepage for the `BeeWare project`_.

It is a `Lektor`_-based site.

If you want to contribute a modification, you can fork this repository and
submit a pull request. However, **do not fork the master branch** - fork the
`lektor branch`_ and make changes there instead.

.. _lektor branch: https://github.com/pybee/pybee.github.io/tree/lektor

If you want to test out a change before you submit it, download and install
`Lektor`_ (note that Lektor is still using Python 2.7):

    $ pip install lektor

Then from the root directory of the checkout, run:

    $ lektor server

.. _Lektor: https://getlektor.com

This will `start a webserver`_ that will autoreload whenever you make a change
to site content.

.. _start a webserver: http://127.0.0.1:5000

Translating
-----------

Want to make BeeWare more accessible to non-English-speakers?  Help translate the site!  Steps are as follows:

1. Add language specification to:

	pybee.github.io/BeeWare.lektorproject

   Fill out the name of the language, its url prefix, and the locale.

2. Add translated mirror files at the same directory level as the primary English files  and add appropriate suffixes.

	For example:

		Arabic's locale is 'ar', so you would add...

		contents+ar.lr

		...where the original file name is:

		contents.lr

Note: A great place to start translating is the contributing section:

	pybee.github.io/content/contributing
