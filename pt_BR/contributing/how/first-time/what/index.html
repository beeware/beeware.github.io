    <h1>What should I do?</h1>
    <p>So you want to help - but where should you start?</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="container">
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-7 mr-auto">
  
  

  
    <p>The best place to start with any open source contribution is with something that
fits your knowledge, experience, and area of interest.</p>
<div class="section" id="before-you-begin">
<h2>Before you begin</h2>
<p>Before you start contributing, it can help to get a feel for the project as a
whole. If you haven't already done the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.beeware.org">BeeWare Tutorial</a>, start there. This will give you exposure to the
most important BeeWare tools, so you can see how they all fit together.</p>
<p>Once you've completed that tutorial, you'll be ready to pick something to work
on. If you had any problems <em>doing</em> the tutorial - if you hit a bug, or if the
language used to describe a step wasn't clear - <em>that's a great place to
start</em>! If you can turn your experience into an improvement in the tutorial,
the next person who does the turorial won't hit the same problem.</p>
<p>However, if your tutorial experience was completely smooth (and we hope it
was!), here are some ideas for where to get involved, depending on your skills
and interests.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="python-programming">
<h2>Python programming</h2>
<div class="section" id="briefcase">
<h3>Briefcase</h3>
<p>If you'd like to contribute to a tool that has a clearly defined problem
statement, but needs bugs squashed and features added, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase">Briefcase</a> may be the project for you. Briefcase
is a tool for packaging a Python project as a standalone GUI application. It
takes a <cite>pyproject.toml</cite> configuration file, and uses that configuration data
to generate installers or distributable application bundles.</p>
<p>The Briefcase <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues">issue tracker</a>
has a collection of feature suggestions (and a smaller number of bugs). If this
is your first time contributing, look for one of the tickets labelled
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">first-timers-only</span></tt> - these are issues that have been specifically picked for
first time contributors because they should be relatively straightforward to
implement. You may also find it helpful to filter the tickets for the platform
you actually use for development - it will be difficult to fix a Linux bug if
you don't have a Linux machine to use for testing!</p>
<p>Pick a ticket, leave a comment that you're looking into the problem, and try
to develop a pull request implementing a fix!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="colosseum">
<h3>Colosseum</h3>
<p>If you like the idea of a very well specified, but complex problem, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/colosseum">Colosseum</a> is a good place to contribute.
Colosseum is a pure-Python, browser implementation of the CSS layout algorithm.
BeeWare uses it to lay out widgets on the screen of an application. The CSS
specification has an extensive test suite; Colosseum needs to pass all those
tests.</p>
<p>The Colosseum documentation has a <a class="reference external" href="https://colosseum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how-to/contribute.html">contribution guide</a> to walk
you through your first Colosseum contribution.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="gui-programming">
<h2>GUI programming</h2>
<p>If you've got experience with a native widget library - Cocoa on macOS, GTK+ on
Linux, Windows Forms, or the native iOS or Android libraries, you may be able to
help with <a class="reference external" href="/project/projects/libraries/toga/">Toga</a>. Toga is a cross platform
widget toolkit - it provides a common interface for user interface elements like
buttons and trees.</p>
<p>Toga has a range of interfaces already defined; however, the implementation of
those interfaces isn't complete across all platforms. Pick a widget, and
implement that widget for your platform of choice!</p>
<p>Even if you <em>don't</em> know a native widget library, you may still be able to help
with Toga. Writing new widgets is a lot less complicated than it may seem.
Every platform has documentation for how to use their native APIs, and the
process of translating that platform documentation from another langauge (e.g.,
Objective C or C#) is a relatively straightforward process. The existing code
should give you some pointers of how this can be done, and the BeeWare team is
happy to help if you need it. Jump on the <a class="reference external" href="https://gitter.im/beeware/general">BeeWare Gitter channel</a> and we'll do whatever we can to help!</p>
<p>If you're not up for transforming code from one language to another - there's
alwasy the test suite. Toga's core library also has a test suite, but the
coverage of that test suite isn't very good. Pick a widget interface, and see
if you can write a test for it!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="documentation">
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>Good documentation is essential for any successful project. We know that <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga">Toga</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase">Briefcase</a> both need significant improvements to
their documentation. You've done the tutorial; now take a look at the
documentation for <a class="reference external" href="https://toga.readthedocs.io">Toga</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://briefcase.readthedocs.io">Briefcase</a> and see if you can find a way to improve
the tutorials, references and topics guides that are there.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tutorials">
<h2>Tutorials</h2>
<p>One of the best ways to contribute is to make sure our introductory and tutorial
documentation is rock solid. Pick a project of interest from the BeeWare suite,
and try to follow the getting started guide and tutorial. If you can't <em>find</em>
the getting started guide - then that's the first thing to report!</p>
<p>As you work through the tutorial, take note of anything that doesn't make sense,
or doesn't work. Then open a bug report for those problems.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="windows">
<h2>Windows</h2>
<p>If you're a Windows user, BeeWare can <em>definitely</em> use your help. The core team
all use Linux and macOS in their daily development, and as a result, it's really
easy for Windows incompatibilities to slip in. This is almost always due to an
oversight. Identifying - and maybe even fixing - problems with running BeeWare
tools on Windows is an immense help.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="languages">
<h2>Languages</h2>
<p>Do you speak a language other than English? At present, the core team are all
native speakers of English. Providing translations of documentation, or
completely new tutorials or guides in your native language is a great way to
contribute. Pick a project that already has documentation and translate that
text. Alternatively, start from scratch and write a completely new tutorial.</p>
<p>If you speak a language with a non-latin character set (e.g., Russian or
Chinese), or a language with a right-to-left script (e.g., Hebrew or Arabic)
you'll be able to point out all the places where we've assumed simple ASCII
encoding or left-to-right conventions. Pick any of the active BeeWare projects,
and try to use it with using your native language. If you hit any problems,
report those problems as bugs; if you are feeling particularly adventurous, see
if you can work out how to <em>fix</em> the bug, too.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="practical-usage">
<h2>Practical usage</h2>
<p>One of the best ways for us to determine where our gaps are - in both
documentation and APIs - is for people to actually use BeeWare to build
something. So, if none of the ideas so far sound interesting, why not try
something of your own? Use the BeeWare suite to build that app you've always
wanted - a desktop visualization of a data source, or a mobile application
to track your activities - whatever it is, try to build it.</p>
<p>We can almost guarantee that you'll hit problems. BeeWare is a still a very
young project. But the problems you hit will give us a great indication of
what needs to be tackled. It will indicate what widgets we need, and what
documentation needs to be improved. So, as you hit problems building your own
app, log issues with the BeeWare projects that caused problems. This will
enable us to identify what we need to improve - and, it might even be a source
of inspiration for you to contribute!</p>
