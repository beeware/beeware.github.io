<h2>Welcome to the BeeWare Sprints!</h2>
<p>Welcome! We're so excited you've decided to join us! If you haven't already
introduced yourself to one of the Bee Team, please do so. Once you've done that,
head back here to get started.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-is-a-sprint">
<h3>What is a sprint?</h3>
<p>A sprint is an unstructured opportunity to spend a few hours or days working
collaboratively on an Open Source project. They're often tied to a conference; a
sprint after a conference provides an opportunity to turn the energy, enthusiasm
and interest that a conference has generated into improvements in the software
we use on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Sprints are also an opportunity to introduce people to the process of
contributing to the project. Our hope is that you'll have so much fun
contributing during the sprint that you'll go home and keep contributing!</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="/contributing/first-time/imposter-syndrome/">It doesn't matter how much experience you've got</a>. At past sprints, we've merged
contributions from people at all levels of experience - high-school students,
recent bootcamp graduates, people who don't consider themselves programmers, and
seasoned developers. No matter your experience level - we can find a way for you
to contribute.</p>
<p>Code isn't the only way you can contribute, either. A project like BeeWare is
much more than just the code - we need people to write, proof-read and translate
documentation; we need people to improve the design of web pages; even the
process of going through bugs that were reported years ago and determining that
they've been fixed along the way is a valuable contribution.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-initial-questions">
<h3>The Initial Questions</h3>
<p>To get you started, we're going to ask a few questions so we can gauge your
interests and experience. This will help us find the best way for you to
contribute. Work through the questions, take notes, and then find a member of
the Bee Team and share your answers. If you don't understand the question being
asked - don't worry about that! Let us know what you do know, and we'll work
together to figure it out from there.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first"><strong>Have you used BeeWare before?</strong></p>
<p>If you haven't, start by working through the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.beeware.org/en/latest/">BeeWare Tutorial</a>. It will give you an introduction
for what the BeeWare project is, and how the pieces of the project fit
together. If you hit any problems doing the tutorial, take notes - because
ensuring nobody else has the same problem is a great topic for a first
contribution!</p>
<p>Once you've finished the tutorial up to at least step 4, move on to the next
question.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>What computing equipment do you have with you?</strong></p>
<p>The equipment you have with you puts practical limits on what you can
contribute to. For example, if you have a Windows laptop, you're not going to
be able to work on anything to do with iOS. Does your laptop run Windows,
macOS, Linux, or something else? Is your phone an iOS or Android device? Have
your devices been provided by your employer, or are they your own personal
devices?</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>How much experience do you have writing Python code?</strong></p>
<p>Are you new to programming? A Python veteran? A coding veteran who has
only just started learning Python? A fresh graduate of a bootcamp program?
We want to find a problem that is a good match for your level experience.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Are you familiar with Github contribution processes?</strong></p>
<p>Do you use GitHub (or a similar code-sharing site) for hosting your own code
or contributing to others' projects? Do you
know what CI (continuous integration) is? Have you contributed to a project that has
pre-commit hooks? If I asked you to &quot;rebase your PR against main&quot;, would you
know what to do?</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Have you contributed to an Open Source project before?</strong></p>
<p>Have you attended a sprint in the past? Have you ever submitted a PR (pull
request) to an Open Source project? Are you familiar with how to use Github
to create a pull request?</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Do you have any other special skills that might be useful?</strong></p>
<p>Are you familiar with a GUI API (such as Winforms, Cocoa, or GTK)? Do you
have deep knowledge of the internals of a particular operating system? Are
you an expert in a programming language other than Python? If you don't have
any special skills, that's not a problem - but if we've got a Windows Guru on
our hands, we want to make sure those skills are being put to good use.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Why did you join us and what are you interested in?</strong></p>
<p>&quot;You sounded like a friendly project&quot; is a perfectly fine answer. However, if
there's more to why you joined us today, let us know. Are you interested in
mobile or desktop development? Packaging? Websites? Console apps? If you
don't have a specific interest - what seems most interesting based on what
you've seen about BeeWare so far?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, find a member of the Bee Team to share your answers. They might ask some
follow up questions; but then they'll point you in the direction of a area where
you should be able to make a contribution.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="find-your-issue">
<h3>Find Your Issue</h3>
<p>If you've spoken to a member of the Bee Team, they have probably pointed you at
a part of the BeeWare project where you can contribute; they might have even
suggested a specific issue to work on. If they haven't given you as specific
issue, they've probably pointed you at the &quot;Good First Issues&quot; for that project.
What does that mean?</p>
<p>GitHub provides a list of issues that allows BeeWare (and other projects) to
keep track of all the problems that have been reported - that includes explicit
bugs, unexpected behavior that <em>might</em> be a bug, requests for new features, requests
for more documentation - anything that might be a way that BeeWare could be
improved. As new issues are reported, the Bee Team will flag some of them as
issues that are well suited to a first time contributor - issues that don't
demand an <em>immediate</em> fix, but are well defined or easy to reproduce, and
probably have a good lead on the underlying cause. These issues are tagged &quot;good
first issue&quot; to make them easier to find.</p>
<p>To filter a GitHub issue list by the &quot;good first issue&quot; label, follow these steps:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Click on the &quot;Labels&quot; button above the list of issues to activate the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>Type the word &quot;good&quot; into the search box at the top of the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>Click on &quot;good first issue&quot; in the filtered list.</li>
</ol>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="The GitHub issue label filter drop-down menu activated with a search for the word &quot;good&quot; to filter down to &quot;good first issue&quot;." src="./github-good-first-issue-filter.png" style="width: 100%;" />
<p class="caption"><em>Filtering GitHub issues by the &quot;good first issue&quot; label.</em></p>
</div>
<p>Once you've found an issue that looks interesting, read through any comments on
the post, and post a comment in the discussion saying that you're looking into
the issue (e.g., &quot;Looking into this at the PyCon US 2025 sprints&quot;). BeeWare
doesn't explicitly &quot;assign&quot; issues - we accept contributions from anyone.
However, in a sprint situation, we need to make sure that we don't end up with
two people working on the same issue - leaving a comment is a light-weight way
to coordinate between contributors.</p>
<p>If you still can't find anything you'd like to do, find a Bee Team member and
they'll help you narrow down to a specific issue.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="set-up-a-development-environment">
<h3>Set up a development environment</h3>
<p>Once you've found an issue, you'll need to set up your development environment
so you can work on a fix. Each BeeWare project has its own contribution guide:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://briefcase.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how-to/contribute/index.html">Briefcase</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://toga.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how-to/contribute/index.html">Toga</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://rubicon-objc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how-to/contribute/index.html">Rubicon ObjC</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If the project isn't on this list, check the project README for details on how
to get set up. If any of the instructions don't make sense (or you can't find
those instructions), find a member of the Bee Team, and they'll get you unstuck.
And - if you think you can improve the instructions so other people won't hit the
same problem, improving the contribution guide is a valuable contribution!</p>
<p>Now you can start working on your issue!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-happens-after-i-submit-my-pr">
<h3>What happens after I submit my PR?</h3>
<p>Once you've submitted your pull request, and the pull request is passing all the
automated checks, you're ready for a review. Let one of the core team know that
you've got a PR ready for review, and they'll take a look.</p>
<p>If this is your first PR, it's quite likely the review will find some problems.
That might be an edge case you didn't consider, or a code convention that you
haven't followed. Don't be discouraged! Nobody - not even the core team - gets
PRs 100% correct on the first try.</p>
<p>Once the PR passes review, your reviewer will merge the PR - and you're done!
Congratulations - you've contributed to BeeWare! If this is your very first
BeeWare contribution, you've also earned your <a class="reference external" href="/contributing/challenge-coins">BeeWare Challenge Coin</a> - find a member of the core team, and they
will give you a coin!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="help-i-m-stuck">
<h3>Help! I'm stuck!</h3>
<p>If you get stuck at any point along the way, find a member of the Bee Team.
Don't be afraid to ask <em>any</em> question. If you're stuck, we want to get you
unstuck. If you're confused, it's because the topic is complicated, and we
haven't explained it well enough. We're eager to help - and we want to make sure
you have a successful sprint.</p>

<p><strong>This guide is new!</strong> PyCon US 2025 is the first time we've used it. We want
your feedback! What worked for you? What didn't? What can we do better? Please
let us know. And remember: fixing a problem with this Sprint Guide counts as a
contribution to BeeWare!</p>
