  <p>One of the benefits of having the support of an organisation like
Anaconda is that we are now in a position to make more concrete
commitments on project goals, and the likely timeframe when key features
will be delivered. To that end, in addition to monthly status updates,
we're going to start publishing regular updates on our project roadmap
so the community has a better idea what to expect over the coming
months.</p>
<p>Project estimation is difficult at the best of times; and project
estimation on a FLOSS project is especially complex. In addition to any
work that we are planning internally as a team, we need to manage
contributions from the community. If a community member contributes a
piece of work that <em>isn't</em> on our roadmap, we need to review that work.
As a result, our ability to deliver on our own roadmap is dependent on
how much is contributed by the community - something that is very hard
to predict ahead of time.</p>
<p>In addition, several of the topics listed on this roadmap are complex,
foundational tasks, and potentially contain unknown complications. As
with any complex work, it can be difficult to predict ahead of time how
long that work will take.</p>
<p>As a result, this roadmap should be read as a guide to what we aim to
focus on over the coming quarter, rather than a hard commitment of
features that will be made available on a specific deadline.</p>
<h2>Q3 priorities</h2>
<p>During Q3, we're planning to work on:</p>
<h3>Linux packaging</h3>
<p>Breifcase's AppImage packaging backend has had <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/718">a cluster of issues
reported</a> related to
inclusion of third party libraries, and the post-processing that needs
to be performed on an AppImage. We've already started work on this
during Q2; early in Q3, you should expect to see this work wrapped up.
This will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding support for linuxdeploy plugins for our existing AppImage
backend; and</li>
<li>Adding a Flatpak backend.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Windows packaging</h3>
<p>Briefcase has an MSI packaging backend for Windows; and while this
backend works, it doesn't deliver an end-user experience that is as
polished as we'd like. We should be starting initial work on Windows
packaging in the coming week, with the complete solution completed in
early Q3. This will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding a stub binary for Windows apps, so that Briefcase apps present
to the task manager with the apps name and icon, rather than
"pythonw";</li>
<li>Improving log capture on Windows, so that it is easier to diagnose
when problems occur; and</li>
<li>Fixing some issues with the way the
<span class="title-ref">site</span> is defined and used. This may also
address some issues we've seen with binary modules in some Windows
apps.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Binary modules</h3>
<p>The biggest caveat on BeeWare's mobile app story has always been that we
don't provide support for binary packages on mobile platforms. In Q3,
we're going to start addressing this limitation.</p>
<p>There are already tools like
<a href="https://github.com/benfogle/crossenv">crossenv</a> that can simplify this
process, and we've got <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/647">a PR in our review
queue</a> that provides a
proof-of-concept implementation of Android binary packaging. We need to
take these tools, plus other tools in the Python ecosystem, and extend
Briefcase so that we can present a clear development story for mobile
developers that want to use modules with binary components.</p>
<p>On iOS, there is an additional complication - we need to resolve how to
manage dynamic loading of modules. BeeWare's iOS support currently
relies on static compilation of all binary modules. This was originally
done because prior to iOS8, dynamic linking was prohibited on iOS. The
days of iOS8 are now long behind us; but the Apple support package has
retained this old approach, mostly because it wasn't clear what approach
Apple would allow through the App Store review process. We will be
making changes to Briefcase's iOS support to accommodate dynamic module
loading, and then extending that support to include user-provided binary
modules.</p>
<h3>Testing (especially GUI testing)</h3>
<p>Without testing, it's very difficult to ensure the stability and
reliability of code in the long term. Unfortunately, many of the areas
where BeeWare operates are inherently difficult to test. Visual GUI
tests are notoriously difficult to perform; packaging tests require the
ability to actually install and run finished applications; testing
mobile applications requires access to mobile device hardware in a CI
setup. As a project, we've avoided writing tests for many of our core
features due to these complexities - and we've paid the price for this
in regressions. Now that we have more time, we can focus on setting up
the frameworks to let us perform this testing.</p>
<p>This includes adding:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Support package tests</strong>, ensuring that the packages include valid
libraries;</li>
<li><strong>App template tests</strong>, ensuring that Briefcase is able to generate
valid and installable applications; and</li>
<li><strong>GUI tests</strong>, ensuring that Toga generates apps that look and behave
the way they should.</li>
</ul>
<p>Testing is an ongoing process, so it's highly unlikely we'll have "100%
test coverage" by the end of the quarter. The goal will be to add the
frameworks that allow us to add tests <em>at all</em>, so that we can retrofit
tests onto existing code, and add tests on all new code going forward.
Ideally, these tests will be fully automated tests running in CI.
However, we may accept semi-automated or manual tests as a short term of
interim measure, especially if those tests lay the groundwork for fully
automated tests in the future.</p>
<h3>Conda integration</h3>
<p>Briefcase is currently uses PyPI and pip as source of Python packages.
However, PyPI and pip isn't the only packaging solution in the Python
ecosystem - another commonly used packaging source is Conda.</p>
<p>At this point, I must recognise the elephant in the room - Anaconda, the
company that produced and maintains Conda, is my employer. However, I
must stress that the fact this is on our roadmap is <em>not</em> as a result of
a directive from my employer. The original <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/596">proposal for this
idea</a> predates even my
earliest hiring discussions with Anaconda. It is being pursued now for
three reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>The key value of Conda is that it simplifies the process of
delivering complex binary packages, and ensuring that the binary
dependencies for those packages are isolated from any packages that
might be present on the user's computer. This core problem statement
shares a lot of similarities with the core problem associated with
application packaging. Conda also has much more nuanced
representation of hardware platforms, alternatives for binary
artefacts, and options for custom repositories. There is a
possibility that using Conda as a packaging base may simplify some
of the problems we've seen with distributing binary dependencies.</li>
<li>There is a significant portion of the Python community that have
commercial needs that requires the use of the managed repositories
provided by Anaconda, or are simply more familiar with Conda tooling
than PyPI/pip.</li>
<li>As a result of having 1 (soon to be 2) full time engineers, we now
have the resources to explore complex changes that might not have
otherwise been explored. We are exploring this idea because we now
have the resources to do so; we were not provided those resources on
the condition that we explore this idea.</li>
</ol>
<p>We don't anticipate dropping support for pip, or for PyPI as a package
source. We're looking at extending Briefcase to provide another commonly
used and requested option for packaging, rather than replacing PyPI/pip.</p>
<h2>Longer term goals</h2>
<p>Looking beyond Q3, the big items on the horizon are:</p>
<h3>Upstreaming</h3>
<p>The Apple and Android support packages maintained by BeeWare include a
number of patches against the core CPython. We want to begin the process
of getting these modifications into the CPython codebase.</p>
<p>There have been two major impediments to this in the past:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Development resources</strong> When we were a volunteer driven project,
we didn't have the resources to engage meaningfully with the CPython
core team to shepherd our patches into the CPython codebase.</li>
<li><strong>Testing</strong> Supported platforms in the CPython codebase need to have
CI solutions.</li>
</ol>
<p>We now have resources, so we can dedicate the time needed to upstream
patches; and once we've completed our testing work in Q3, we'll be in a
position to recommend CI configurations to the CPython core team. That
means the work of upstreaming patches and making iOS and Android fully
supported platforms can begin.</p>
<h3>Toga 1.0</h3>
<p>The broad goal for "Toga 1.0" could be considered "Tkinter, but with
some additional bells to show off". We want to deliver a core widget set
of the "essentials", plus some nice features to show off, like WebViews
and camera or GPS integration. The exact set of features for Toga 1.0 is
still a subject for discussion; I'd expect to see a more concrete
feature list and plan emerge in Q4.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>As with most of the work that has been done in Q2, the foundational work
we're planning for Q3 is not as glamorous as adding high profile GUI
widgets, but it's all necessary work if we're going to provide a stable
and reliable development story. Once this foundation is established,
we'll be in a much better position to rapidly develop new features that
<em>are</em> visible - and to ensure that those features are stable and
reliable as BeeWare develops.</p>
