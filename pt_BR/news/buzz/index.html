  <p>In Q1, BeeWare hit some major milestones for support of iOS and Android on mobile platforms; but we still have more work to do. As always, this roadmap should be read as a guide to what we aim to focus on over the coming quarter, rather than a hard commitment of features that will be made available on a specific deadline.</p>
<div class="section" id="q1-progress">
<h2>Q1 progress</h2>
<p>In Q1, we made major progress in the state of binary packaging for iOS and Android. PyPI now accepts binary wheel uploads; and we have uploaded wheels for one package (pyspamsum) to prove that this support works. We've also contributed changes in cibuildwheel that supports the creation of iOS binary wheels. We need to wait until those changes are in an official cibuildwheel release before we can contribute patches upstream for other projects, but we have patches for a couple of projects ready to submit as soon as there is an official release to use. We've completed some preparatory work in CPython and pip to support building Android binary wheels, but the changes to cibuildwheel to support Android wheels are still in the early stages of development.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, our collaboration with the PyScript team didn't work out as expected; the opportunity to work with the PyScript team that we anticipated did not eventuate. However, a group of students from Curtin University will be working on Toga's web backend as part of their final year capstone project. This will include making modifications to Briefcase to support testing web-based apps. This project will run until the end of the year; we look forward to seeing the progress they're able to make.</p>
<p>However, we <em>have</em> made good progress on Emscripten support in CPython. A buildbot for Emscripten is almost ready to launch; having a stable buildbot is a major milestone in restoring Emscripten to Tier 3 support in CPython. Draft PEPs defining the Emscripten platform (PEP 776) and Emscripten wheel tagging (PEP 783) are currently in discussion.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="q2-priorities">
<h2>Q2 priorities</h2>
<p>In Q2, we're planning to continue working on binary packaging for mobile platforms. This work will take three forms:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>We'll continue working on the cibuildwheel patch to support building Android wheels. Now that the iOS patch has landed in cibuildwheel, we're in a position to use that patch as a template for the analogous changes needed to support Android.</li>
<li>We'll continue to work on generating patches to third-party projects to prove that the tooling we've developed for mobile binary wheels is sufficient to support the entire Python ecosystem. We're currently working on Numpy; Cryptography will likely be the next project we look into.</li>
<li>We will start the process of formalising and standardising the work that we've done to support iOS and Android packaging. With PyCon US approaching rapidly, we want to get these discussions underway so that we can make the most of the opportunity provided by having a large portion of the Python community in one place. There are two major areas that require formalisation - the production of official binaries for iOS and Android support; and the state of cross-platform build environments.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the work we're doing on mobile binary wheels, we're expecting to work on improving Briefcase, with a view to making Briefcase's tooling for packaging, signing and notarization useful as standalone utilities, without the need to use Briefcase to package the entire app.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="longer-term-goals">
<h2>Longer term goals</h2>
<p>The long term goals of BeeWare remain largely the same. Once we've developed a compelling story for mobile binary packaging, we'll be able to turn our focus back to Toga. There's a number of navigation and data organization widgets that need to be developed; we also need to improve documentation of some common development patterns that are sources of common questions in BeeWare support channels. Unless pull requests are submitted from the broader community, it is unlikely that we'll make any substantial progress on this front until the end of this year, or perhaps early next year.</p>
<p>We're also intending to look at tooling other than <tt class="docutils literal">pip</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">venv</tt> for building Briefcase packages. Integration with Conda is one obvious goal, as it provides rich tooling for distributing complex binary requirements. <tt class="docutils literal">uv</tt> is another tool that might fit well in the Briefcase development story. Again, it is unlikely that we'll make any progress on this front before the end of this year.</p>

  </p>
  
  <p>March has seen a big release for Toga, and a number of other notable improvements in the BeeWare ecosystem.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-we-ve-done">
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/toga/0.5.0/">Toga 0.5.0 has been released</a>! It's been over 5 months since our last feature release of Toga; this release includes a number of major improvements to Toga's style layer, and some significant improvements in iOS and macOS memory handling. This release includes a number of backwards incompatible changes; check the <a class="reference external" href="https://toga.readthedocs.io/en/stable/background/project/releases.html#backward-incompatible-changes">Toga 0.5.0 release notes</a> for details.</li>
<li>We added a new <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3114">Toga-Positron bootstrap</a>. This bootstrap is a Briefcase plugin that provides an easy way to start a new project that uses a web browser as the primary UI. This is effectively the equivalent of Electron-style apps - but the code is entirely written in Python, and works on iOS and Android. It also allows for hybrid apps: as the underlying app is a Toga app, you can mix Toga widgets into the layout that is being used. The bootstrap allows you to convert a Django website or static web server into a mobile app; it also provides a way to generate a &quot;single site browser&quot; - converting a single public URL into a standalone app on your desktop.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3273">modified the way that style properties are applied to Toga widgets</a>. Style updates are now applied in batch updates, dramatically reducing the amount of repeated work required when changing the appearance of a widget.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3293">improved the UX of the Winforms Table widget</a>, ensuring that the selected row is still visible when a table doesn't have focus.</li>
<li>We improved Toga's <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3270">handling of the asyncio event loop on Windows</a>. This change ensures that Winforms apps always clean up the event loop on exit; previously, it was possible for warnings to be raised on application exit, caused by open sockets and unawaited co-routines.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3268">modified the handling of alignment style properties</a> to ensure that when text <em>direction</em> is changed, the layout of the app is re-evaluated.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3217">added support for controlling inter-line spacing in multiline text on a canvas</a>.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3118">corrected some issues with background color handling on Android</a>.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3256">corrected some issues with supporting PyGObject on Linux distributions that are based on Debian 12 (including Ubuntu 22.04)</a>. This was necessary because of a backwards incompatible change introduced into the PyGObject 3.52.1 release; unfortunately, users of older Linux distributions may need to make some modifications to their projects.</li>
<li>The pull request <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/pull/2286">adding iOS support to cibuildwheel</a> has been merged. With this change, a simple package can build binary wheels for iOS with a single command: <tt class="docutils literal">CIBW_PLATFORM=ios cibuildwheel</tt>. This PR then <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/pull/2337">required a follow-up investigation and fix</a> to correct an intermittent issue that was seen when running the cibuildwheel tests in CI.</li>
<li>We've started work on a follow-up PR to cibuildwheel, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/pull/2317">adding support for explicitly declaring safe cross-build tools</a>. This is a use case that was identified during the development of PR for iOS support.</li>
<li>We corrected a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2212">long standing issue with PTH file handling in Briefcase</a>.</li>
<li>We added the ability to invoke <tt class="docutils literal">briefcase build</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">briefcase package</tt> on <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2201">a single application in a Briefcase project</a>.</li>
<li>We began work on a patch to support generating iOS binary wheels for NumPy. This is a work in progress; we've got a set of patches that allows us to <em>compile</em> NumPy, but the test suite won't run yet.</li>
<li>We created a process to make an official <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/131532">binary release of Python for Android</a>, which should be available on python.org starting with Python 3.14. This will reduce duplicated effort across Python on Android tools, and ensure binary compatibility in the packaging ecosystem.</li>
<li>We submitted pull requests adding Android support to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pypa/packaging/pull/880">packaging</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/13303">pip</a>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-s-next">
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>Binary packaging will continue to be an area of focus in April. In addition to finishing the work on the &quot;safe cross-build tools&quot; patch, we will continue to work on porting &quot;real world&quot; packages (like NumPy) to discover any gaps that exist in the mobile packaging story. During April, we also hope to submit a PR to support Android in cibuildwheel; and to start a discussion with the rest of the Python packaging community about the use of cross-platform build environments.</p>
<p>We'll also continue to work on Python Emscripten support. The Emscripten buildbot is almost ready to launch; we have one last technical issue to resolve, and then we'll be able to add Emscripten to the CPython buildbot fleet.</p>
<p>There's also good news for Toga's Web backend - a group of students from Curtin University will be working on Toga's web backend as part of their final year capstone project. This will include making modifications to Briefcase to support testing web-based apps. Some of the improvements to Toga and Briefcase that landed this month are the result of those students becoming familiar with BeeWare's contribution process. This project will run until the end of the year; we look forward to seeing the progress they're able to make.</p>
<p>Looking a little further ahead - in May, we'll be attending PyCon US! We're presenting a <a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2025/schedule/presentation/78/">talk</a> and a <a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2025/schedule/presentation/147/">tutorial</a>; and we'll be there for the first 3 days of the sprints. We'll have a presence at the Anaconda booth in the main hall; we'll be attending other events (such as the language summit) during the conference; and we're hoping to plan some open spaces. Ticket sales are open - we hope to see you there!</p>

  </p>
  
  <p>February may be the shortest month - but it's been a month of big progress for BeeWare!</p>
<div class="section" id="what-we-ve-done">
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The biggest news for the month is that <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/17559">it is now possible to upload iOS and Android wheels to PyPI</a>! This is ultimately a very small change adding a list of allowed tags to the underlying PyPI codebase - but it is an important step towards the goal of having the Python ecosystem support iOS and Android as a first class citizen.</li>
<li>We submitted a pull request <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/pull/2286">adding iOS support to cibuildwheel</a>. With this change, a simple package can build binary wheels for iOS with a single command: <tt class="docutils literal">CIBW_PLATFORM=ios cibuildwheel</tt>. As proof, we <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/pyspamsum/1.0.7/#files">built and published iOS wheels for a simple binary package</a>. For completeness, we also built and uploaded Android wheels using our <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/chaquo/chaquopy/blob/master/server/pypi/README.md">existing Chaquopy-based build tooling</a>; in the near future, we're hoping to replace that with a cibuildwheel-based approach as well.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/beeware.github.io/pull/578">completed a major refactor of the BeeWare website</a>. This dramatically simplifies the structure of some parts of the website - most notably, the projects page. A huge thanks to community member <a class="reference external" href="https://kattni.com">Kattni</a> for all their hard work on this refactor.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/briefcase/0.3.22/">released Briefcase 0.3.22</a>. This is a bug fix release to silence a warning raised during builds caused by the release of pip 25.0. This warning had the potential to become an error at an unknown point in the future, so we decided to push out a low-feature release to avoid that possibility.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/toga/0.4.9/">released Toga 0.4.9</a>. This release contains only 1 change over the 0.4.8 release - it imposes an upper bound on the version of Travertino that it specifies as a requirement. This ensures that when we release the next version of Travertino, we don't need to accomodate compatibility with Toga 0.4 APIs.</li>
<li>We added <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3087">initial support for GTK4 to Toga</a>. This is only the very initial phases of GTK4 support - most widgets aren't currently supported - but the basic infrastructure that allows a GTK4 app to start <em>at all</em> now exists. We now need to go through the process of porting every GTK widget for GTK4 compatibility. Thanks to the work we did on the Toga 0.4 widget audit, we have a comprehensive test suite that we can use to evaluate progress on this task.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2484">corrected some issues with background color handling on Windows</a>, including adding support for transparency on widget backgrounds. This also included adding support for <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3140">alpha blending to Travertino</a>.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3181">corrected a long-standing issue that caused instability in Toga's iOS tests</a>.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/129200">corrected a problem with the CPython iOS test runner</a> that prevented multiple test runners starting at the same time, and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/130292">another problem that was caused when running the runner under CI conditions</a>.</li>
<li>We upgraded the CPython iOS buildbot to run on macOS Sonoma, and Xcode 16.4; this some issues with iOS 18 compatibility that we have resolved.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-s-next">
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>In March we will continue to work on binary packaging. Although it is now possible to upload binary wheels to PyPI, that capability isn't much use unless projects are able to build those wheels in the first place. In the process of developing the pull request for cibuildwheel, we've identified a gap in the  <a class="reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/">PEP 517</a> specification associated with building more complex binary packages, and a set of missing features in virtual environments in a cross-platform build configuration. We have some ideas for how to fill these gaps; but we need to do some more experimentation to prove that those approaches will work as expected. The eventual goal will be to author a PEP to address these gaps in the PEP 517 standard. We should also be able to begin the process of adding Android binary wheel support, mirroring the changes we've made for iOS over the past months.</p>
<p>We'll also continue to work on Python Emscripten support. The Emscripten buildbot is almost ready to launch; we have one last technical issue to resolve, and then we'll be able to add Emscripten to the CPython buildbot fleet.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it looks like the work we were planning on Toga's Web backend will be deferred. We believed we may have had an opportunity to work with another group at Anaconda to improve Toga's web backend, but that opportunity looks like it will not eventuate. We're still interested in improving the web backend, but we probably won't be able to commit significant resources to that project in the near future.</p>

  <p>It's the start of a new year, and we've already seen some big improvements to BeeWare!</p>
<div class="section" id="what-we-ve-done">
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/briefcase/0.3.21/">released Briefcase 0.3.21</a>.</li>
<li>We modified Briefcase to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2101">use the native iOS platform support that was added in pip v24.3</a>.</li>
<li>We made <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2110">substantial improvements to Briefcase's macOS notarization tools</a>. It is now possible to suspend and resume a Briefcase notarization attempt.</li>
<li>We made <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2096">Briefcase's check of system tools more resilient on Debian-based systems</a>, accounting for situations where users have installed all the constituent pieces of the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">build-essential</span></tt> meta package, but haven't actually installed <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">build-essential</span></tt>.</li>
<li>We modified the Briefcase bootstrap API to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2114">give the bootstrap access to the Briefcase console and logging tools</a>.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2124">simplified the handling of console, input and logging in Briefcase</a>.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2121">promoted Linux on ARM64 to a fully supported platform in Briefcase</a>.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2121">improved error reporting when the underlying tools used by Briefcase fail</a>.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2853">resolved some memory leaks in Toga's iOS backend</a>.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3068">added an API to Toga's WebView for retrieving cookies</a>.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3107">modified the constructor of Toga widgets to allow for style definitions to be provided as keyword arguments to the widget, rather than requiring a separate Pack object</a>.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3113">added aliases for some common horizontal and vertical alignment style properties to Pack</a>.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3116">added Row and Column functions</a> as aliases for a Box with horizontal and vertical direction styles, respectively.</li>
<li>We added <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2096">event handlers for changes in focus and visibility on Toga Window objects</a>. This also provides a mechanism for mobile apps to respond to being moved to and from a background state.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3086">migrated the Travertino codebase into the Toga repository</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3129">got Travertino's test suite to 100% branch coverage</a>. This should make it easier to coordinate changes in Travertino with the corresponding changes in Toga.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3009">corrected some issues with background color handling on iOS</a>.</li>
<li>We modified Rubicon ObjC to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/pull/558">add support for recent changes to the way Python manages asyncio event loops</a>.</li>
<li>We formally published <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/setuptools-dynamic-dependencies/">setuptools-dynamic-dependencies</a>. This is a setuptools plugin that allows dependencies to be specified as dynamic properties. This is a tool that we've used for a while to ensure that <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">toga-cocoa==X</span></tt> has a dependency on <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">toga-core==X</span></tt>; it's now been formally published on PyPI for anyone to use.</li>
<li>We continued to work on binary iOS packaging. We're almost ready to submit some changes to <tt class="docutils literal">cibuildwheel</tt> to formally add support for building iOS packages.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-s-next">
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>In February, we'll continue to work on binary packaging - we hope to be able to submit pull requests to <tt class="docutils literal">cibuildwheel</tt> adding iOS support in the coming weeks. We may also begin the process of adding Android binary wheel support, mirroring the changes we've made for iOS.</p>
<p>We'll continue to work on Python Emscripten support. We're almost ready to stand up an Emscripten buildbot; this may happen in February. Lastly, we'll continue to work on Toga's Web backend, with the eventual aim of getting the web backend to the same level of support as the other Toga backends.</p>

  <p>Progress in Q4 was slower than anticipated, but there have been some notable success in achieving BeeWare's overall project goals. As always, this roadmap should be read as a guide to what we aim to focus on over the coming quarter, rather than a hard commitment of features that will be made available on a specific deadline.</p>
<div class="section" id="q4-progress">
<h2>Q4 progress</h2>
<p>Our goal for Q4 was to have at least one third-party package producing Android and iOS packages as part of their release process. We were unable to achieve this goal, for four reasons.</p>
<p>Firstly, we underestimated the chain of downstream dependencies that needed to be addressed before it would be possible to submit mobile packaging PRs to upstream projects. We correctly identified <tt class="docutils literal">pip</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">cibuildwheel</tt> as two projects that would need to be updated; however, we didn't anticipate that those projects would themselves have upstream dependencies and issues that would require patching. The process of coming up to speed with the development tooling of multiple upstream projects, navigating the review processes of each of those projects, and sequencing changes over multiple projects so they are easier to merge has taken much longer than we anticipated.</p>
<p>Secondly, we underestimated how much work would be needed on the target projects themselves to make them ready for mobile support. We picked Pillow as one of our target projects because of its complex chain of binary dependencies. However we soon discovered that the way those binary dependencies were compiled for <em>macOS</em> required significant alteration before working on an iOS patch would be possible.</p>
<p>Third, the release of Xcode 16 included an unexpected surprise - it broke the mechanism we were using to gather results from test suites running on the iOS simulator. This required a significant change in CPython; however, as a result, we now have a much better mechanism for collecting test results, and the test harness the CPython uses to run its own tests can now be used to run test suites for any other Python project.</p>
<p>Lastly, we were presented with an opportunity to work closely with the PyScript team on web support, to the benefit of both projects. This redirected some of the resources that we originally anticipated would be used for Android binary packaging. However, it does mean that some significant improvements to Toga's web backend have been made, with more on the horizon in the new year.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, we have made significant progress. <tt class="docutils literal">pip</tt> now includes full support for iOS wheel tags. The patch adding a major feature to <tt class="docutils literal">cibuildwheel</tt> that is a pre-requisite for iOS support has been accepted; we've been told this patch should be merged within days. We've submitted changes to Pillow that allow macOS builds to be completely isolated from Homebrew, and the patches required to support cross-platform builds of Pillow's binary dependencies have been merged. This leaves 2 patches that need to be merged - a patch to cibuildwheel adding support for building on iOS; and the patch to Pillow adding an iOS build configuration. These patches have been prepared, and are mostly ready for submission upstream; using these patches, it is possible to fully build and test Pillow wheels for iOS with cibuildwheel.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="q1-priorities">
<h2>Q1 priorities</h2>
<p>In Q1, we will continue to work on binary packaging for mobile platforms. We will continue to work on landing the patches to <tt class="docutils literal">cibuildwheel</tt> and Pillow for iOS support; once that work has concluded, we hope to start making the analogous changes required to support Android.</p>
<p>Q1 will also see the continuation of our collaboration with PyScript. The major focus for BeeWare in this work will be Toga's Web backend - and in particular, Toga's testing infrastructure. We're not currently able to run Toga's testbed project on the web backend (or the Textual backend, for that matter). We have some ideas for how this could be addressed; these ideas may not be fully realised by the end of Q1, but we hope to at least have a concrete plan, and maybe even a prototype in place.</p>
<p>Lastly, with the CPython 3.14 development process well underway, there are two projects that we intend to work on, with the goal of having this work incorporated into Python 3.14. The first is the creation of official &quot;embedded&quot; distributions of CPython for more platforms. Python already produces an embedded build for Windows, and Briefcase is able to use this distribution as part of the process of creating Windows binaries. We hope that Python 3.14 will contain analogous builds for macOS, iOS and Android, removing the need for BeeWare (and other projects) to maintain independent CPython builds. We've had some initial discussions with the CPython release team; we hope that by the end of the quarter, we'll have a plan for how to deliver this work.</p>
<p>The second CPython feature we'd like to address is handling of cross-platform virtual environments - that is, creating a virtual environment that can &quot;pretend&quot; it is running on a different host platform. This is necessary for cross-platform builds, which require the ability to create an isolated PEP 517 build environment that can run Python on the local machine, but report platform-identifying information as if it were running on the target machine. A version of this cross-environment virtualization has been necessary to support <tt class="docutils literal">cibuildwheel</tt>; however, it would be desirable to upstream this work so that it can be standardised as part of a stock Python environment. We hope to start discussions about this with the CPython core team in the near future.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="longer-term-goals">
<h2>Longer term goals</h2>
<p>Once we've got a strong story for packaging third-party packages for iOS and Android, we'll be able to turn our focus back to Toga, and the work needed to make iOS and Android compelling app development platforms. There's a number of navigation and data organization widgets that need to be developed; we also need to improve documentation of some common development patterns that are sources of common questions in BeeWare support channels.</p>
<p>We'll should also be in a position to start working on the long list of projects in the Python ecosystem that would benefit from having iOS and Android support upstream. <tt class="docutils literal">cryptography</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">numpy</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">pandas</tt> will be the highest priority for this work, but there's a very long tail of useful projects that have binary modules; ideally they'd all have iOS and Android support.</p>

  <p>Work in December (and the publication of this update!) was slowed by the end-of-year break; but BeeWare still made some significant progress to round out the year.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-we-ve-done">
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>We added a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2999">GTK implementation of Geolocation services</a>.</li>
<li>We made a number of improvements to Pack, Toga's style API. This includes <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3054">adding a &quot;justify-content&quot; style directive</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3036">adding a &quot;gap&quot; style directive</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3033">updating a number of Pack properties to match their CSS names</a>.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2942">standardised the way in which Toga widgets are instantiated</a>. This simplifies the implementation process, and guarantees that the initial styles added to a widget are always applied.</li>
<li>We added an API for <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2473">reporting and controlling the state of Toga windows</a>.</li>
<li>We began modifying Toga to be <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2976">compatible with MicroPython</a>. MicroPython is significantly smaller than the full CPython install, reducing the startup time for web apps.</li>
<li>We updated <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2080">Briefcase's web template to use a more recent PyScript version</a>.</li>
<li>We added <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2089">support for console apps in the Briefcase project conversion wizard</a>.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2085">improved error handling when updating Briefcase templates</a>, accounting for some global git configuration options that were causing problems for some users.</li>
<li>We added <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2059">explicit support for passing options to pip</a> when installing dependencies with Briefcase. This is mostly useful for specifying alternative package repositories (with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--index-url</span></tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--extra-index-url</span></tt>) or local folders that contain wheels (with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--find-links</span></tt>); but any pip arguments can be passed down to the pip invocation.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2075">corrected an error in the default D-Bus configuration of Flatpak apps</a>.</li>
<li>We resolved a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/pull/543">long-standing memory management issue in Rubicon</a>. This change removes almost all need for manual memory management of ObjC objects, making iOS and macOS development much more robust. It also resolves some memory leak issues on Toga's iOS backend.</li>
<li>We added support for CPython to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/127592">stream stdout and stderr to the system log on iOS and macOS</a>. This change included a improved tool for running CPython test suites, making it possible to stream the output of a CPython test suite while the test suite is running, and to run the an arbitrary test suite, not just the CPython test suite.</li>
<li>Our patch <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/pull/2062">adding a test-sources configuration in cibuildwheel</a> has been accepted, and should be merged in a couple of days.</li>
<li>We reviewed a large number of improvements to Emscripten support in CPython.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-s-next">
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>We'll publish a full Q1 roadmap in a day or two; but our goal for January will be to continue the work we were doing in December. We'll continue to push patches upstream to support binary packaging, with iOS support for Pillow being the immediate goal. We'll continue to work on Python Emscripten support, and Toga's Web backend, with the eventual aim of getting the web backend to the same level of support as the other Toga backends. We're planning to publish new versions of Rubicon ObjC, Travertino and Toga in the coming days; these are major updates that will involve some minor backwards compatibilities. Lastly, we've had a number of reports of bugs with Briefcase's macOS notarization and Windows packaging which we will be investigating.</p>

  <p>In November, BeeWare made more good progress on mobile packaging - however, that work has revealed a number of upstream tools that need modification before we can contribute wheels for mobile platforms.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-we-ve-done">
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>We attended <a class="reference external" href="https://2024.pycon.org.au">PyCon AU</a>; video of the talk we gave on accessing phone hardware from Python <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLNWwNHgTco">is available on YouTube</a>. We also had a very productive sprint - 9 contributors earned their <a class="reference external" href="https://beeware.org/contributing/challenge-coins/">challenge coin</a>, for contributions ranging from <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/beeware/pull/450">corrections to the tutorial</a>, to the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2992">addition of a dark mode flag to Toga</a>. We also gave out one Yak Herder coin, for someone who helps other people to get their challenge coin. A huge thank you to everyone that came along and participated!</li>
<li>Our patch for Pillow <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/pull/8497">isolating its build system from Homebrew when building on macOS</a> has been finalised and merged. This is essential for iOS support, as it's easy for Homebrew macOS ARM64 binaries to leak into iOS builds; but it also has benefits for macOS builds.</li>
<li>We've completed work on modifications to the Pillow build system to support building for iOS. However, testing this work has revealed the need for additional changes to cibuildwheel and the upstream CPython support for iOS.</li>
<li>We've submitted a PR to cibuildwheel to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/pull/2062">add a test-sources configuration item</a>. This feature is required for iOS testing, but can also be used on other platforms, so we've contributed it independently in order to make the iOS changes easier to test.</li>
<li>We've started work on some modifications to how the CPython iOS testbed project is run. This has become necessary because of <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/126925">a change introduced in Xcode 16</a>, but in order to fix the problem, we'll also be able to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/126821">improve the reporting of test output during a test run</a>, and also make the test harness useful as a generic utility for <em>any</em> iOS project.</li>
<li>We've made good progress towards resolving a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/pull/543">long-standing memory management issue in Rubicon</a>. This change will remove almost all need for manual memory management of ObjC objects, making iOS and macOS development much more robust.</li>
<li>We resolved a number of CPython test stability issues on Android. In most cases, this wasn't an indicator of a broken feature, but of an unstable test - but as a result of the extensive testing done by CPython as a project, even a small instability can manifest as a semi-regular test failure.</li>
<li>We've started work on <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2976">modifying Toga's web backend to be compatible with Micropython</a>.

<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>December will be a short month because of end-of-year holidays; we'll be continuing to work on binary packaging. The work we've done porting Pillow to iOS has revealed a number of gaps in the tooling needed to develop and test packages for iOS; so we will be working on getting that upstream tooling in place, using Pillow as a demonstrator for that work. Our overall goal hasn't changed - to get tools in place so that third-party projects can officially support iOS and Android - but it's become clear that there's a lot more upstream work required than we originally anticipated. However, we'll keep working toward this goal until creating packages for iOS and Android is as straightforward as any other platform.</p>
<p>We'll also be continuing to work on Python Emscripten support, and Toga's Web backend, with the eventual aim of getting the web backend to the same level of support as the other Toga backends.</p>

  <p>In October, BeeWare saw some important releases, plus more good progress on binary packaging for iOS.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-we-ve-done">
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Most importantly, we released <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/briefcase/0.3.20/">Briefcase 0.3.20</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/toga/0.4.8/">Toga 0.4.8</a>, including support for Python 3.13 - which includes the official support in Python for iOS and Android! This is a major milestone for BeeWare as a project, representing a significant portion of the work done over the last 12 months.</li>
<li>We've prepared an <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/freakboy3742/cibuildwheel/tree/ios-support">initial patch to cibuildwheel that is able to build and test simple iOS wheels</a>. This patch isn't ready to submit upstream, but it is able to build simple iOS wheels.</li>
<li>We've submitted a patch to Pillow to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/pull/8497">isolate its build system from Homebrew when building on macOS</a>. This is essential for iOS support, as it's easy for Homebrew macOS ARM64 binaries to leak into iOS builds; but it also has benefits for macOS builds.</li>
<li>We've made <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/multi-build/multibuild">a number of improvements to multibuild</a>, the tooling that Pillow uses to compile non-Python binary dependencies.</li>
<li>We've <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/126169">modified the CPython iOS testbed project</a> so that it can be used as a testbed for <em>any</em> iOS Python project.</li>
<li>We've <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2033">improved error reporting when Briefcase can't clone a template</a>.</li>
<li>We've switched to using <tt class="docutils literal">httpx</tt> instead of <tt class="docutils literal">requests</tt> for <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2041">Briefcase's internal download handling</a>. This provides slightly better error handling, better options for improving HTTP/2 usage, and we're now consistently using <tt class="docutils literal">httpx</tt> in Briefcase and in our example code.</li>
<li>We've modified Toga to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2686">lazily load components</a>, rather than importing everything into the <tt class="docutils literal">toga</tt> namespace at startup. This should improve application startup times, especially on platforms like mobile and web where this startup time is noticeable.</li>
<li>We resolved an issue causing <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2893">intermittent test failures when testing Toga on Wayland</a>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-s-next">
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>We will be continuing to work on binary packaging in November. We're using Pillow as a demonstrator for this work - it's a package that has a significant binary component, is widely used (including on mobile), but has a non-trivial build process (largely due to the non-Python binary dependencies). The hope is that by the time we're able to compile Pillow for iOS, we will have resolved many of the issues facing other binary packages. Our goal remains to have at least <em>some</em> third-party projects officially supporting iOS and Android by the end of the year, but this may be impeded by the sequence of dependencies that need to land and be published before upstream projects can accept iOS and Android patches.</p>
<p>We'll also be speaking at <a class="reference external" href="https://2024.pycon.org.au">PyCon AU</a> at the end of the month, including attending both days of the sprints. If you're able to make it to Narrm/Melbourne, we hope we'll see you there!</p>

  </p>
  
  <p>Q3 has seen some major progress against long term goals of the BeeWare project. As always, this roadmap should be read as a guide to what we aim to focus on over the coming quarter, rather than a hard commitment of features that will be made available on a specific deadline.</p>
<div class="section" id="q3-progress">
<h2>Q3 progress</h2>
<p>In Q3 the biggest milestone we achieved was the finalisation of Tier 3 support for Android in CPython. The last of the compatibility and documentation issues associated with Android have been resolved, and Android buildbots are now running for both x86_64 and ARM64. Python 3.13.0 is due for release in about a week; we should be in a position to support this release very soon after the official release.</p>
<p>We've also made significant progress on binary packaging. We've backported all the Python 3.13 patches for iOS into BeeWare's support for Python 3.9-3.12, and we've updated our Mobile Forge infrastructure to generate binary wheels for a number of popular packages. We've developed iOS compatibility patches for pip and crossenv; these patches have been submitted and received initial reviews; we'll continue to work with those projects to land these patches upstream.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="q4-priorities">
<h2>Q4 priorities</h2>
<p>In Q4, we'll be focussing on the tools and documentation needed to for third-party Python packages to add Android and iOS support to their official CI and release processes. In addition to contributing to tools like <tt class="docutils literal">pip</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">cibuildwheel</tt>, we'll develop the tools and documentation needed so that it is easy to add CI configurations for mobile platforms. The hope is that by the end of the year, there will be at least one third-party package that produces Android and iOS wheels without any direct involvement of the BeeWare team.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="longer-term-goals">
<h2>Longer term goals</h2>
<p>Once we've got a strong story for packaging third-party packages for iOS and Android, we'll be able to turn our focus back to Toga, and the work needed to make iOS and Android compelling app development platforms. There's a number of navigation and data organization widgets that need to be developed; we also need to improve documentation of some common development patterns that are sources of common questions in BeeWare support channels.</p>
<p>There are also further improvements that we'd like to see in Python itself. This year we've been able to get Android and iOS to Tier 3 support; getting those platforms to Tier 2 is an obvious goal for future Python releases. We'd also like to contribute the tooling needed so that Python is able to distribute official binary releases of iOS and Android, and add an official macOS artefact that mirrors the &quot;Windows embedded&quot; installer. We've had discussions with the Python core team about how this could be achieved; over the coming year, we hope to land these changes.</p>

  <p>In September, BeeWare hit an important milestone for Android support, made good progress on packaging for iOS, and landed some significant changes to Toga.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-we-ve-done">
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Android is <a class="reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0011/#tier-3">now officially a Tier 3 platform in CPython</a>! Over the last month, we've resolved a number of bugs that were preventing us from deploying a reliable buildbot for Android (on both x86_64 and ARM64); as a result, the CPython buildbot fleet now contains Android buildbots. The Android-related changes to documentation have also been merged; Python 3.13.0rc3 (due for release any day now) will incorporate all these changes.</li>
<li>We completed the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/mobile-forge/pull/55">updates to Mobile Forge to support the new official iOS wheel format</a>, and published updated wheels in this format for the packages for which we have recipes. As part of these changes, we've also added CI checks to Mobile Forge.</li>
<li>We've <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/12962">submitted a patch to support iOS in pip</a>. This patch also requires some patches to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pypa/packaging/pull/832">packaging</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pypa/distlib/pull/231">distlib</a> that pip includes as vendored copies.</li>
<li>We've <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/benfogle/crossenv/pull/117">submitted a patch to crossenv</a> that allows cross-compiling Python packages for iOS. There is some additional work required before this patch can land - crossenv's testing framework is currently broken, so it's not currently possible to verify changes in CI. We'll be working on restoring this testing support in the very near future.</li>
<li>We attended the CPython core team summit. During this week-long sprint, we were able to resolve a number of open questions about Python support on mobile, and begin planning for work that will hopefully be incorporated into the Python 3.14 release.</li>
<li>We released <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/toga/0.4.7/">Toga 0.4.7</a>, incorporating fixes for a number of bugs discovered in the recent 0.4.6 release, as well as some minor feature additions.</li>
<li>We transitioned Toga's GTK backend to use <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2550">PyGObject's native asyncio support</a>. This allowed us to deprecate <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/gbulb">Gbulb</a>, the GTK asyncio plugin that we've been maintaining for several years.</li>
<li>We corrected an issue with the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2822">use of recent Textual versions in Toga</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2823">added a bare-bones runtime test</a> to ensure that the problem doesn't re-occur. This also required a fix for <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1992">macOS console app testing in Briefcase</a>.</li>
<li>We made some <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2831">usability improvements to the rendering of Toga's documentation</a>, and modified Toga's ReadTheDocs configuration to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2833">encourage search engines to return the stable documentation by default</a>.</li>
<li>We modified the handling of Toga's app icons on macOS to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2852">improve compatibility with PyInstaller</a>.</li>
<li>We corrected a number of issues with WebView handling, including <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2815">ensuring that DOM storage is always available</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2781">improving error handling when the WebView cannot be initialised on Windows</a>.</li>
<li>We added protection against an edge case of asynchronous Task handling that could lead to the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2814">premature garbage collection of long lived tasks</a>. We've also had some discussions with the CPython core team about <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/121264">fixing this problem in Python itself</a>.</li>
<li>We spoke at <a class="reference external" href="https://pybay.org">PyBay</a> on building mobile apps in Python.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-s-next">
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>In October, we will continuing working on binary package support for mobile platforms. In addition to responding to any review feedback on the patches we've already submitted, we'll be working on new patches for <tt class="docutils literal">cibuildwheel</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">meson-python</span></tt>, as well as tooling to make it easy for third-party libraries to run CPython test suites on mobile platforms. We should also be able finalise Briefcase's Python 3.13 support for Android, and start work on Android packaging. Supporting packaging for mobile platforms is a long term project which we expect to continue for several months; the hope is that by the end of the year, we will be able to contribute patches to third-party projects so that iOS and Android wheels become officially produced, rather than BeeWare-maintained artefacts.</p>
