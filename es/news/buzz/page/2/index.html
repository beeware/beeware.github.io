  </p>
  
  <p>Progress in Q4 was slower than anticipated, but there have been some
notable success in achieving BeeWare's overall project goals. As always,
this roadmap should be read as a guide to what we aim to focus on over
the coming quarter, rather than a hard commitment of features that will
be made available on a specific deadline.</p>
<h2>Q4 progress</h2>
<p>Our goal for Q4 was to have at least one third-party package producing
Android and iOS packages as part of their release process. We were
unable to achieve this goal, for four reasons.</p>
<p>Firstly, we underestimated the chain of downstream dependencies that
needed to be addressed before it would be possible to submit mobile
packaging PRs to upstream projects. We correctly identified <code>pip</code> and
<code>cibuildwheel</code> as two projects that would need to be updated; however,
we didn't anticipate that those projects would themselves have upstream
dependencies and issues that would require patching. The process of
coming up to speed with the development tooling of multiple upstream
projects, navigating the review processes of each of those projects, and
sequencing changes over multiple projects so they are easier to merge
has taken much longer than we anticipated.</p>
<p>Secondly, we underestimated how much work would be needed on the target
projects themselves to make them ready for mobile support. We picked
Pillow as one of our target projects because of its complex chain of
binary dependencies. However we soon discovered that the way those
binary dependencies were compiled for <em>macOS</em> required significant
alteration before working on an iOS patch would be possible.</p>
<p>Third, the release of Xcode 16 included an unexpected surprise - it
broke the mechanism we were using to gather results from test suites
running on the iOS simulator. This required a significant change in
CPython; however, as a result, we now have a much better mechanism for
collecting test results, and the test harness the CPython uses to run
its own tests can now be used to run test suites for any other Python
project.</p>
<p>Lastly, we were presented with an opportunity to work closely with the
PyScript team on web support, to the benefit of both projects. This
redirected some of the resources that we originally anticipated would be
used for Android binary packaging. However, it does mean that some
significant improvements to Toga's web backend have been made, with more
on the horizon in the new year.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, we have made significant progress. <code>pip</code> now
includes full support for iOS wheel tags. The patch adding a major
feature to <code>cibuildwheel</code> that is a pre-requisite for iOS support has
been accepted; we've been told this patch should be merged within days.
We've submitted changes to Pillow that allow macOS builds to be
completely isolated from Homebrew, and the patches required to support
cross-platform builds of Pillow's binary dependencies have been merged.
This leaves 2 patches that need to be merged - a patch to cibuildwheel
adding support for building on iOS; and the patch to Pillow adding an
iOS build configuration. These patches have been prepared, and are
mostly ready for submission upstream; using these patches, it is
possible to fully build and test Pillow wheels for iOS with
cibuildwheel.</p>
<h2>Q1 priorities</h2>
<p>In Q1, we will continue to work on binary packaging for mobile
platforms. We will continue to work on landing the patches to
<code>cibuildwheel</code> and Pillow for iOS support; once that work has concluded,
we hope to start making the analogous changes required to support
Android.</p>
<p>Q1 will also see the continuation of our collaboration with PyScript.
The major focus for BeeWare in this work will be Toga's Web backend -
and in particular, Toga's testing infrastructure. We're not currently
able to run Toga's testbed project on the web backend (or the Textual
backend, for that matter). We have some ideas for how this could be
addressed; these ideas may not be fully realised by the end of Q1, but
we hope to at least have a concrete plan, and maybe even a prototype in
place.</p>
<p>Lastly, with the CPython 3.14 development process well underway, there
are two projects that we intend to work on, with the goal of having this
work incorporated into Python 3.14. The first is the creation of
official "embedded" distributions of CPython for more platforms. Python
already produces an embedded build for Windows, and Briefcase is able to
use this distribution as part of the process of creating Windows
binaries. We hope that Python 3.14 will contain analogous builds for
macOS, iOS and Android, removing the need for BeeWare (and other
projects) to maintain independent CPython builds. We've had some initial
discussions with the CPython release team; we hope that by the end of
the quarter, we'll have a plan for how to deliver this work.</p>
<p>The second CPython feature we'd like to address is handling of
cross-platform virtual environments - that is, creating a virtual
environment that can "pretend" it is running on a different host
platform. This is necessary for cross-platform builds, which require the
ability to create an isolated PEP 517 build environment that can run
Python on the local machine, but report platform-identifying information
as if it were running on the target machine. A version of this
cross-environment virtualization has been necessary to support
<code>cibuildwheel</code>; however, it would be desirable to upstream this work so
that it can be standardised as part of a stock Python environment. We
hope to start discussions about this with the CPython core team in the
near future.</p>
<h2>Longer term goals</h2>
<p>Once we've got a strong story for packaging third-party packages for iOS
and Android, we'll be able to turn our focus back to Toga, and the work
needed to make iOS and Android compelling app development platforms.
There's a number of navigation and data organization widgets that need
to be developed; we also need to improve documentation of some common
development patterns that are sources of common questions in BeeWare
support channels.</p>
<p>We'll should also be in a position to start working on the long list of
projects in the Python ecosystem that would benefit from having iOS and
Android support upstream. <code>cryptography</code>, <code>numpy</code> and <code>pandas</code> will be
the highest priority for this work, but there's a very long tail of
useful projects that have binary modules; ideally they'd all have iOS
and Android support.</p>



  
  
  <h2><a href="/es/news/buzz/december-2024-status-update/">December 2024 Status Update</a></h2>

    en 6 January 2025 
  </p>
  
  <p>Work in December (and the publication of this update!) was slowed by the
end-of-year break; but BeeWare still made some significant progress to
round out the year.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul>
<li>We added a <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2999">GTK implementation of Geolocation
services</a>.</li>
<li>We made a number of improvements to Pack, Toga's style API. This
includes <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3054">adding a "justify-content" style
directive</a>, <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3036">adding a "gap"
style directive</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3033">updating a number of Pack properties to match their CSS
names</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2942">standardised the way in which Toga widgets are
instantiated</a>. This
simplifies the implementation process, and guarantees that the initial
styles added to a widget are always applied.</li>
<li>We added an API for <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2473">reporting and controlling the state of Toga
windows</a>.</li>
<li>We began modifying Toga to be <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2976">compatible with
MicroPython</a>. MicroPython
is significantly smaller than the full CPython install, reducing the
startup time for web apps.</li>
<li>We updated <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2080">Briefcase's web template to use a more recent PyScript
version</a>.</li>
<li>We added <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2089">support for console apps in the Briefcase project conversion
wizard</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2085">improved error handling when updating Briefcase
templates</a>, accounting
for some global git configuration options that were causing problems
for some users.</li>
<li>We added <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2059">explicit support for passing options to
pip</a> when installing
dependencies with Briefcase. This is mostly useful for specifying
alternative package repositories (with <code>--index-url</code> or
<code>--extra-index-url</code>) or local folders that contain wheels (with
<code>--find-links</code>); but any pip arguments can be passed down to the pip
invocation.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2075">corrected an error in the default D-Bus configuration of Flatpak
apps</a>.</li>
<li>We resolved a <a href="https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/pull/543">long-standing memory management issue in
Rubicon</a>. This
change removes almost all need for manual memory management of ObjC
objects, making iOS and macOS development much more robust. It also
resolves some memory leak issues on Toga's iOS backend.</li>
<li>We added support for CPython to <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/127592">stream stdout and stderr to the
system log on iOS and
macOS</a>. This change
included a improved tool for running CPython test suites, making it
possible to stream the output of a CPython test suite while the test
suite is running, and to run the an arbitrary test suite, not just the
CPython test suite.</li>
<li>Our patch <a href="https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/pull/2062">adding a test-sources configuration in
cibuildwheel</a> has been
accepted, and should be merged in a couple of days.</li>
<li>We reviewed a large number of improvements to Emscripten support in
CPython.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>We'll publish a full Q1 roadmap in a day or two; but our goal for
January will be to continue the work we were doing in December. We'll
continue to push patches upstream to support binary packaging, with iOS
support for Pillow being the immediate goal. We'll continue to work on
Python Emscripten support, and Toga's Web backend, with the eventual aim
of getting the web backend to the same level of support as the other
Toga backends. We're planning to publish new versions of Rubicon ObjC,
Travertino and Toga in the coming days; these are major updates that
will involve some minor backwards compatibilities. Lastly, we've had a
number of reports of bugs with Briefcase's macOS notarization and
Windows packaging which we will be investigating.</p>

    en 1 December 2024 
  </p>
  
  <p>In November, BeeWare made more good progress on mobile packaging -
however, that work has revealed a number of upstream tools that need
modification before we can contribute wheels for mobile platforms.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul>
<li>We attended <a href="https://2024.pycon.org.au">PyCon AU</a>; video of the talk
we gave on accessing phone hardware from Python <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLNWwNHgTco">is available on
YouTube</a>. We also had a
very productive sprint - 9 contributors earned their <a href="https://beeware.org/contributing/challenge-coins/">challenge
coin</a>, for
contributions ranging from <a href="https://github.com/beeware/beeware/pull/450">corrections to the
tutorial</a>, to the
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2992">addition of a dark mode flag to
Toga</a>. We also gave out one
Yak Herder coin, for someone who helps other people to get their
challenge coin. A huge thank you to everyone that came along and
participated!</li>
<li>Our patch for Pillow <a href="https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/pull/8497">isolating its build system from Homebrew when
building on macOS</a>
has been finalised and merged. This is essential for iOS support, as
it's easy for Homebrew macOS ARM64 binaries to leak into iOS builds;
but it also has benefits for macOS builds.</li>
<li>We've completed work on modifications to the Pillow build system to
support building for iOS. However, testing this work has revealed the
need for additional changes to cibuildwheel and the upstream CPython
support for iOS.</li>
<li>We've submitted a PR to cibuildwheel to <a href="https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/pull/2062">add a test-sources
configuration item</a>.
This feature is required for iOS testing, but can also be used on
other platforms, so we've contributed it independently in order to
make the iOS changes easier to test.</li>
<li>We've started work on some modifications to how the CPython iOS
testbed project is run. This has become necessary because of <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/126925">a change
introduced in Xcode
16</a>, but in order to
fix the problem, we'll also be able to <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/126821">improve the reporting of test
output during a test
run</a>, and also make
the test harness useful as a generic utility for <em>any</em> iOS project.</li>
<li>We've made good progress towards resolving a <a href="https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/pull/543">long-standing memory
management issue in
Rubicon</a>. This
change will remove almost all need for manual memory management of
ObjC objects, making iOS and macOS development much more robust.</li>
<li>We resolved a number of CPython test stability issues on Android. In
most cases, this wasn't an indicator of a broken feature, but of an
unstable test - but as a result of the extensive testing done by
CPython as a project, even a small instability can manifest as a
semi-regular test failure.</li>
<li>We've started work on <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2976">modifying Toga's web backend to be compatible
with Micropython</a>. This
significantly reduces the startup time for a Toga app; we're hoping to
be able to spend a lot more time on the web backend in the coming
year.</li>
<li>We've <a href="https://github.com/python/steering-council/issues/256">formally taken on responsibility for restoring Emscripten to
Tier 3 support in
CPython</a>, and
reviewed a number of patches aimed at restoring Emscripten support.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>December will be a short month because of end-of-year holidays; we'll be
continuing to work on binary packaging. The work we've done porting
Pillow to iOS has revealed a number of gaps in the tooling needed to
develop and test packages for iOS; so we will be working on getting that
upstream tooling in place, using Pillow as a demonstrator for that work.
Our overall goal hasn't changed - to get tools in place so that
third-party projects can officially support iOS and Android - but it's
become clear that there's a lot more upstream work required than we
originally anticipated. However, we'll keep working toward this goal
until creating packages for iOS and Android is as straightforward as any
other platform.</p>
<p>We'll also be continuing to work on Python Emscripten support, and
Toga's Web backend, with the eventual aim of getting the web backend to
the same level of support as the other Toga backends.</p>

  <p>In October, BeeWare saw some important releases, plus more good progress
on binary packaging for iOS.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul>
<li>Most importantly, we released <a href="https://pypi.org/project/briefcase/0.3.20/">Briefcase
0.3.20</a> and <a href="https://pypi.org/project/toga/0.4.8/">Toga
0.4.8</a>, including support for
Python 3.13 - which includes the official support in Python for iOS
and Android! This is a major milestone for BeeWare as a project,
representing a significant portion of the work done over the last 12
months.</li>
<li>We've prepared an <a href="https://github.com/freakboy3742/cibuildwheel/tree/ios-support">initial patch to cibuildwheel that is able to build
and test simple iOS
wheels</a>.
This patch isn't ready to submit upstream, but it is able to build
simple iOS wheels.</li>
<li>We've submitted a patch to Pillow to <a href="https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/pull/8497">isolate its build system from
Homebrew when building on
macOS</a>. This is
essential for iOS support, as it's easy for Homebrew macOS ARM64
binaries to leak into iOS builds; but it also has benefits for macOS
builds.</li>
<li>We've made <a href="https://github.com/multi-build/multibuild">a number of improvements to
multibuild</a>, the tooling
that Pillow uses to compile non-Python binary dependencies.</li>
<li>We've <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/126169">modified the CPython iOS testbed
project</a> so that it can
be used as a testbed for <em>any</em> iOS Python project.</li>
<li>We've <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2033">improved error reporting when Briefcase can't clone a
template</a>.</li>
<li>We've switched to using <code>httpx</code> instead of <code>requests</code> for <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2041">Briefcase's
internal download
handling</a>. This
provides slightly better error handling, better options for improving
HTTP/2 usage, and we're now consistently using <code>httpx</code> in Briefcase
and in our example code.</li>
<li>We've modified Toga to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2686">lazily load
components</a>, rather than
importing everything into the <code>toga</code> namespace at startup. This should
improve application startup times, especially on platforms like mobile
and web where this startup time is noticeable.</li>
<li>We resolved an issue causing <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2893">intermittent test failures when testing
Toga on Wayland</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>We will be continuing to work on binary packaging in November. We're
using Pillow as a demonstrator for this work - it's a package that has a
significant binary component, is widely used (including on mobile), but
has a non-trivial build process (largely due to the non-Python binary
dependencies). The hope is that by the time we're able to compile Pillow
for iOS, we will have resolved many of the issues facing other binary
packages. Our goal remains to have at least <em>some</em> third-party projects
officially supporting iOS and Android by the end of the year, but this
may be impeded by the sequence of dependencies that need to land and be
published before upstream projects can accept iOS and Android patches.</p>
<p>We'll also be speaking at <a href="https://2024.pycon.org.au">PyCon AU</a> at the
end of the month, including attending both days of the sprints. If
you're able to make it to Narrm/Melbourne, we hope we'll see you there!</p>

  </p>
  
  <p>Q3 has seen some major progress against long term goals of the BeeWare
project. As always, this roadmap should be read as a guide to what we
aim to focus on over the coming quarter, rather than a hard commitment
of features that will be made available on a specific deadline.</p>
<h2>Q3 progress</h2>
<p>In Q3 the biggest milestone we achieved was the finalisation of Tier 3
support for Android in CPython. The last of the compatibility and
documentation issues associated with Android have been resolved, and
Android buildbots are now running for both x86_64 and ARM64. Python
3.13.0 is due for release in about a week; we should be in a position to
support this release very soon after the official release.</p>
<p>We've also made significant progress on binary packaging. We've
backported all the Python 3.13 patches for iOS into BeeWare's support
for Python 3.9-3.12, and we've updated our Mobile Forge infrastructure
to generate binary wheels for a number of popular packages. We've
developed iOS compatibility patches for pip and crossenv; these patches
have been submitted and received initial reviews; we'll continue to work
with those projects to land these patches upstream.</p>
<h2>Q4 priorities</h2>
<p>In Q4, we'll be focussing on the tools and documentation needed to for
third-party Python packages to add Android and iOS support to their
official CI and release processes. In addition to contributing to tools
like <code>pip</code> and <code>cibuildwheel</code>, we'll develop the tools and documentation
needed so that it is easy to add CI configurations for mobile platforms.
The hope is that by the end of the year, there will be at least one
third-party package that produces Android and iOS wheels without any
direct involvement of the BeeWare team.</p>
<h2>Longer term goals</h2>
<p>Once we've got a strong story for packaging third-party packages for iOS
and Android, we'll be able to turn our focus back to Toga, and the work
needed to make iOS and Android compelling app development platforms.
There's a number of navigation and data organization widgets that need
to be developed; we also need to improve documentation of some common
development patterns that are sources of common questions in BeeWare
support channels.</p>
<p>There are also further improvements that we'd like to see in Python
itself. This year we've been able to get Android and iOS to Tier 3
support; getting those platforms to Tier 2 is an obvious goal for future
Python releases. We'd also like to contribute the tooling needed so that
Python is able to distribute official binary releases of iOS and
Android, and add an official macOS artefact that mirrors the "Windows
embedded" installer. We've had discussions with the Python core team
about how this could be achieved; over the coming year, we hope to land
these changes.</p>



  
  
  <h2><a href="/es/news/buzz/september-2024-status-update/">September 2024 Status Update</a></h2>
  <p class="meta">

  </p>
  
  <p>In September, BeeWare hit an important milestone for Android support,
made good progress on packaging for iOS, and landed some significant
changes to Toga.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul>
<li>Android is <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0011/#tier-3">now officially a Tier 3 platform in
CPython</a>! Over the last
month, we've resolved a number of bugs that were preventing us from
deploying a reliable buildbot for Android (on both x86_64 and ARM64);
as a result, the CPython buildbot fleet now contains Android
buildbots. The Android-related changes to documentation have also been
merged; Python 3.13.0rc3 (due for release any day now) will
incorporate all these changes.</li>
<li>We completed the <a href="https://github.com/beeware/mobile-forge/pull/55">updates to Mobile Forge to support the new official
iOS wheel format</a>,
and published updated wheels in this format for the packages for which
we have recipes. As part of these changes, we've also added CI checks
to Mobile Forge.</li>
<li>We've <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/12962">submitted a patch to support iOS in
pip</a>. This patch also requires
some patches to
<a href="https://github.com/pypa/packaging/pull/832">packaging</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/pypa/distlib/pull/231">distlib</a> that pip includes
as vendored copies.</li>
<li>We've <a href="https://github.com/benfogle/crossenv/pull/117">submitted a patch to
crossenv</a> that allows
cross-compiling Python packages for iOS. There is some additional work
required before this patch can land - crossenv's testing framework is
currently broken, so it's not currently possible to verify changes
in CI. We'll be working on restoring this testing support in the very
near future.</li>
<li>We attended the CPython core team summit. During this week-long
sprint, we were able to resolve a number of open questions about
Python support on mobile, and begin planning for work that will
hopefully be incorporated into the Python 3.14 release.</li>
<li>We released <a href="https://pypi.org/project/toga/0.4.7/">Toga 0.4.7</a>,
incorporating fixes for a number of bugs discovered in the recent
0.4.6 release, as well as some minor feature additions.</li>
<li>We transitioned Toga's GTK backend to use <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2550">PyGObject's native asyncio
support</a>. This allowed us
to deprecate <a href="https://github.com/beeware/gbulb">Gbulb</a>, the GTK
asyncio plugin that we've been maintaining for several years.</li>
<li>We corrected an issue with the <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2822">use of recent Textual versions in
Toga</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2823">added a
bare-bones runtime test</a> to
ensure that the problem doesn't re-occur. This also required a fix for
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1992">macOS console app testing in
Briefcase</a>.</li>
<li>We made some <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2831">usability improvements to the rendering of Toga's
documentation</a>, and
modified Toga's ReadTheDocs configuration to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2833">encourage search engines
to return the stable documentation by
default</a>.</li>
<li>We modified the handling of Toga's app icons on macOS to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2852">improve
compatibility with
PyInstaller</a>.</li>
<li>We corrected a number of issues with WebView handling, including
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2815">ensuring that DOM storage is always
available</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2781">improving
error handling when the WebView cannot be initialised on
Windows</a>.</li>
<li>We added protection against an edge case of asynchronous Task handling
that could lead to the <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2814">premature garbage collection of long lived
tasks</a>. We've also had some
discussions with the CPython core team about <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/121264">fixing this problem in
Python itself</a>.</li>
<li>We spoke at <a href="https://pybay.org">PyBay</a> on building mobile apps in
Python.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>In October, we will continuing working on binary package support for
mobile platforms. In addition to responding to any review feedback on
the patches we've already submitted, we'll be working on new patches for
<code>cibuildwheel</code> and <code>meson-python</code>, as well as tooling to make it easy
for third-party libraries to run CPython test suites on mobile
platforms. We should also be able finalise Briefcase's Python 3.13
support for Android, and start work on Android packaging. Supporting
packaging for mobile platforms is a long term project which we expect to
continue for several months; the hope is that by the end of the year, we
will be able to contribute patches to third-party projects so that iOS
and Android wheels become officially produced, rather than
BeeWare-maintained artefacts.</p>

  </p>
  
  <p>August has seen some good progress on BeeWare's support for Python 3.13,
plus a number of long-awaited features landing in a stable release of
Toga.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul>
<li>We've completed the process of backporting the CPython changes for iOS
compatibility to Python 3.9 through 3.12. We've published support
packages and stub binaries that incorporate these changes, and made
the <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1934">changes to Briefcase needed to support these new
versions</a>.</li>
<li>We've begun work on updating Mobile Forge and related binary tooling
to support the new official binary tag and framework format required
by the PEP-compliant patch for iOS support. So far, we're able to
compile simple binary packages like <code>lru-dict</code>, and non-Python
dependencies like <code>libjpeg</code>; we're working on restoring binary support
for more complex binary dependencies.</li>
<li>We've landed the <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/121595">Android test runner
script</a>, fixed a number
of issues that have arisen in CPython's Android support since the
original patches landed, and <a href="https://buildbot.python.org/#/builders/1594">deployed an Android CPython
buildbot</a>. This buildbot
has revealed some edge cases (primarily in socket and signal handling)
that only appear to manifest under the unusual load conditions
generated by a buildbot; so, we've temporarily disabled the buildbot
while we investigate the cause of these problems.</li>
<li>We completed work on <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2666">a new API for document-based
apps</a>.</li>
<li>We completed work on <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2768">an API for status icon
apps</a>.</li>
<li>We released <a href="https://pypi.org/project/toga/0.4.6/">Toga 0.4.6</a>. This
includes the support for document-based apps, status icon apps, and a
number of other long-awaited features, such as apps without menubars,
available in a stable release.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2764">updated the support for WebView on
Windows</a> to a more recent
version, and <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2778">resolved an issue with compatibility with Windows Store
Python</a>.</li>
<li>We diagnosed and contributed fixes for a number of issues in tools
that BeeWare depends on for our build tooling. This includes updates
to CI configurations to support Sphinx 8, <a href="https://github.com/crate/sphinx_csv_filter/pull/49">fixes for Sphinx 8 support
in a Sphinx
plugin</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/twisted/towncrier/issues/632">diagnosing issues with a recent Towncrier
update</a>.</li>
<li>We presented a keynote at <a href="https://kiwipycon.nz">Kiwi PyCon</a> on the
future of Python.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>In September, we'll be continuing work on binary package support for
mobile platforms. Once we've restored support for binary wheels using
the new binary tag and framework format, and added support for Python
3.13, we'll start upstreaming the changes we've made so that the wider
Python ecosystem can start supporting iOS and Android. We'll also start
working on the fixes to tools like <code>pip</code>, <code>cibuildwheel</code>, and
<code>meson-python</code> that need to have explicit iOS support. We expect that
this work will be ongoing for several months, but some of the work
should be submitted upstream for review by the end of the month.</p>
<p>We'll also be presenting at talk at <a href="https://pybay.org">PyBay</a> in San
Francisco on mobile app development in Python, followed by the CPython
core team sprint.</p>

  </p>
  
  <p>July saw a lot of our attention being consumed by the upcoming Python
3.13 release; but we've also seen some other improvements to the BeeWare
suite.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul>
<li>We've resolved a number of issues with iOS and Android compatibility
in CPython 3.13. Although patches for iOS and Android compatibility
landed months ago, a number of changes have been landed since then
which have inadvertently broken compatibility with these platforms.
These issues usually indicate a subtle issue with the implementation
of the feature that has been added - but diagnosing and correcting the
source of the problem can often take days. There have also been some
small improvements made to the iOS patches, such as a configuration
option <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/121947">ensuring App Store compliance for both iOS and
macOS</a>.</li>
<li>We've begun the process of backporting the CPython changes for iOS
compatibility to the older supported CPython releases. So far, we've
completed the port to 3.12, and the 3.11 port is mostly complete;
backports for 3.10 and 3.9 should be underway shortly. This includes
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/Python-Apple-support/pull/191">significant changes to the
Python-Apple-support</a>
repository, switching the build of the macOS support package to be
based on the official CPython download, and adding a CI test suite
that can be used to simplify the process of making a new release.</li>
<li>We've almost completed adding a <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/121595">test runner script for
Android</a>. This will
form the basis for an Android CPython buildbot in the very near
future.</li>
<li>We've added support for <a href="https://github.com/beeware/cpython-apple-source-deps/commit/f2bb2149098083f84da3993db86d1106b90d9456">using an externally managed libmpdec
implementation</a>
to the iOS patch. This is a change that was <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/115119">recently introduced to
CPython</a>, and will
become required in CPython 3.15.</li>
<li>We've <em>almost</em> completed work on <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2666">a new API for document-based
apps</a>.</li>
<li>We've developed an <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/97">initial design and prototype for status icon
apps</a>.</li>
<li>We've added an API to make it <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2714">easier to add and remove commands from
a Toga app</a>.</li>
<li>We corrected an issue that was causing <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2730">intermittent Toga CI failures
on macOS</a>.</li>
<li>We've improved Briefcase's <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1915">validation of the version of Git that a
user has installed</a>.</li>
<li>We've <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1910">corrected an issue with the way macOS signs
apps</a>. This was
causing problems with apps that have particularly complex application
layouts.</li>
<li>We've modified Briefcase to use the <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1929">newly available "stripped" Python
Standalone binaries on
Linux</a>.</li>
<li>We've <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1846">improved the validation of document type declarations in a
Briefcase project</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>In August, we'll be continuing preparations for the upcoming Python 3.13
release, and working on the mobile Python binary packaging ecosystem.
The initial release candidate for Python 3.13 will be released very
soon; with any luck, this means there should be less inadvertent
breakages to diagnose, so we can focus on improvements to tools like
<code>pip</code>, <code>cibuildwheel</code>, <code>meson-python</code> and more. We expect that this work
will take most of the rest of the quarter to release; but there should
be some initial signs of progress by the end of the month.</p>
<p>We'll also be at <a href="https://kiwipycon.nz">Kiwi PyCon</a>, presenting a
keynote about the future of Python.</p>

  </p>
  
  <p>We're halfway through the year, and BeeWare has seen another quarter of
significant progress. As always, this roadmap should be read as a guide
to what we aim to focus on over the coming quarter, rather than a hard
commitment of features that will be made available on a specific
deadline.</p>
<h2>Q2 progress</h2>
<p>The biggest news for the quarter is that iOS is now officially a Tier 3
supported platform in CPython. All the patches required for iOS
compatibility have been landed, and a buildbot is in place; as of
3.13.0b1, CPython will build for iOS without any patching. Android
support is close behind; the only missing piece is the buildbot.</p>
<p>We made some major improvements to the BeeWare tutorial, adding sections
on customization of the packaged app, and handling permissions for apps.
We were able to use these changes as part of a well-received tutorial at
PyCon US. We also ran a very successful booth and sprint at PyCon US.</p>
<p>We also completed a lot of improvements in Briefcase and Toga, expanding
the types of apps that can be supported. Briefcase can now package
console apps; and Toga now has an official API for apps that don't have
menu bars, background apps, and apps that aren't governed by the
lifecycle of a single "main" window. These have been the subject of
long-standing feature requests (some of them almost as old as Toga
itself), so it's great to be able to finally address these limitations.</p>
<p>The one area where we weren't able to make an progress was in packaging
for mobile platforms. However, we did have some very productive
discussions at PyCon US, so we're confident we'll be able to make good
progress on this in the coming quarter.</p>
<h2>Q3 priorities</h2>
<p>The highest priority for Q3 is to get ready for the Python 3.13 release
in early October. This involves finalising the work on the Android
buildbot so that Android is officially Tier 3; preparing Briefcase and
the Python builds that BeeWare supports to be ready for the 3.13
release; and doing as much work as we can on the packaging ecosystem so
that package maintainers can publish wheels for iOS and Android.</p>
<p>We'll also be attending <a href="https://kiwipycon.nz">Kiwi PyCon</a> in August,
and attending the Python Core Team summit in September.</p>
<h2>Longer term goals</h2>
<p>Getting the Python ecosystem to support iOS and Android is requires a
lot more than just adding patches to CPython and some related tools.
There will be a lot of education and support work required to help the
community adopt iOS and Android; and there is certain to be ongoing
maintenance as Python and the platforms evolve. There are also many ways
that Python mobile support could be made even better, including the
publication of official iOS and Android binaries, and potentially
getting to Tier 2 (or even Tier 1) support.</p>
<p>There's also a lot of work that can be done to Toga to make iOS and
Android compelling platforms to develop for. Toga is still missing some
key widgets to support navigation and data organization; and even when
these widgets exist, there will be a need for documentation and examples
to demonstrate how to build apps for these platforms. We anticipate
we'll be looking at these towards the end of the year. We also
anticipate that we'll start looking more seriously at Toga's web
backend, attempting to bring it to a level of support comparable to the
desktop and mobile platforms.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>It's been another busy quarter with a lot of progress, but as always,
there's still plenty to do. Completing official support for iOS and
Android means the foundational work needed to support mobile platforms
will be complete; we can then focus on what we - and the community -
build on that foundation.</p>



  
  
  <h2><a href="/es/news/buzz/june-2024-status-update/">June 2024 Status update</a></h2>
  <p class="meta">
    Publicado por

  </p>
  
  <p>In June, BeeWare made a lot of progress, landing lots of new features -
many of which have been the subject of requests and discussions for a
long time.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1781">added support for packaging console apps to
Briefcase</a>. This
involved adding a new <code>.pkg</code> packaging type for macOS, as well as a
number of other improvements to the stub app and MSI packaging on
Windows. In addition to providing a way to package console apps on
macOS, the addition of <code>.pkg</code> format means it is now possible to
distribute apps using centralised device management tooling (such as
Kandji or FleetDM).</li>
<li>We modified Briefcase to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1849">distribute the stub binaries as standalone
artefacts, rather than including them in the app
template</a>. We also
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1855">significantly optimised how Briefcase uses
templates</a>. Between
these two changes, the download size required for a first project on
macOS has been reduced from around 200MB, to less than 4MB.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1864">isolated Briefcase's use of
Cookiecutter</a> so that
all of Briefcase's cached content is contained in Briefcase's own
cache folder.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1856">added support for distribution certificates on
macOS</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2585">modified Toga's APIs to use namedtuple types for Size and Position
references</a>.</li>
<li>We corrected a number of stability issues with Toga's testbed CI, and
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2670">added CI testing for Wayland on
Linux</a>.</li>
<li>We completed a <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2252">major overhaul of typing in Toga's API
surface</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2642">added support for conditional coverage in Toga's
testing</a>. It is now
possible to get a clean coverage report without running the test suite
on every Python version and every platform.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2636">added an official API for customizing the system-installed menu
items</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1930">added an API for detecting the screens available for an app to
use, and for setting the position of windows relative to those
screens</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2649">added support for "simple"
apps</a> - apps that don't
have menu bars.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2651">added support for apps whose lifecycle isn't tied to a single
"Main" window</a>, such as
background apps (apps that don't have any windows) and document-based
apps.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2669">added support for app modal
dialogs</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>Work on Toga's App interface isn't quite finished - we're expecting to
finalise the Document API in the near future. Once that work is
complete, our focus will be the mobile Python binary packaging
ecosystem. The work we've done so far this year has led to CPython 3.13
formally supporting iOS and Android as Tier 3 supported platforms; the
next step is ensuring that the rest of the community can build iOS and
Android packages. This will involve improvements to tools like <code>pip</code>,
<code>cibuildwheel</code>, <code>meson-python</code> and more. We expect that this work will
take most of the rest of the quarter to release; but there should be
some initial signs of progress by the end of the month.</p>
<h2>Want to get involved?</h2>
