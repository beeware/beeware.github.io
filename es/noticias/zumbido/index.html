  <p>Google Summer of Code is coming to an end. I've spent the summer working on optimizing the
<a class="reference external" href="/project/projects/bridges/voc/">VOC compiler</a>, and I’m super excited to share the results.</p>
<div class="section" id="results">
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>There are a couple of ways to evaluate the performance improvement from my project.</p>
<div class="section" id="microbenchmarks">
<h3>Microbenchmarks</h3>
<p>Firstly, we introduced a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/voc/blob/master/tests/microbenchmarks.py">microbenchmarking suite</a>. Each microbenchmark is a small piece
of Python code that tests a single and specific Python construct, or datatype, or control flow.
The benchmarking infrastructure itself is crude (essentially it just tells you the total amount
of processor time it took to run, with no fancy statistics) but it has been extremely useful to
me while working on performance features to verify performance gain.</p>
<p>The idea is that the benchmarking suite is not to be run as part of the full test suite,
but rather as needed and manually whenever an optimization is implemented. It also provides a way to
check and prevent performance regression, especially on the &quot;optimized&quot; parts of VOC. While it
doesn't really make sense to record specific numbers, as they will always vary from machine to machine,
it should be reasonably easy to compare two versions of VOC. Benchmark numbers are included on each
optimization-related PR I've worked on this summer (see PR log below), and I hope that more benchmarks
will be added as more performance efforts are carried out in the future.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pystone">
<h3>Pystone</h3>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/voc/blob/master/tests/benchmarks/pystone.py">Pystone</a> is a Python <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhrystone">Dhrystone</a>, a standard benchmark for testing the performance of Python on a machine.
Here are the before and after results on my machine:</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Some things that I learned about VOC while working on this project:</p>
<p>1. Object creation in the JVM is expensive. This definitely does not mean that the VOC user
writing Python should think about minimizing the number of objects that she creates, but rather
that any time we can non-trivially reduce the number of objects created during bytecode
transpilation or in VOC-defined function calls, we can expect to see a huge performance boost.
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/voc/pull/825">Integer</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/voc/pull/830">boolean preallocation</a>, which is about reusing objects that have already been created,
was one of the most significant improvements we made this summer.</p>
<p>2. Method calls in VOC are expensive. This is essentially due to the process of invoking a callable:
you have to check that the method is defined on the object, then construct it (read: object creation!),
and check the arguments, before it can actually be called. (This is done using reflection, which is super
interesting and confusing in itself.) And this is the reason why <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/voc/pull/875">refactoring the Python comparison functions</a>
made such a big performance impact, because we were able to circumvent this process.</p>
<p>3. Exception-heavy code is expensive. Again, this is not to say that the programmer is on the hook for being
frugal when throwing exceptions, but that VOC benefits greatly by avoiding the use of exceptions internally
except when strictly necessary. For instance, Python uses StopIteration exceptions to signal the end of a for loop,
and they quickly rack up when you have nested loops (everything is ultimately related to object creation!). That was
the motivation for the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/voc/pull/881">nested loops optimization</a>.</p>
<p>If I may be a bit more reflective here, one of the a-ha! moments I had this summer was realizing that to really
optimize something, you have to understand where its biggest problems are first. I remember pitching to Russ at
the start of the summer things like loop unrolling, constant folding, even converting to SSA-form (you know, stuff I
heard about optimzation in my compilers class) and he was saying to me, think simpler. While working on my project,
I used a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jprofiler/overview.html">profiler</a> to understand exactly which parts of VOC were slow, and that information drove the changes we
implemented. I think it worked out pretty well!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="future-work">
<h2>Future Work</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Minimize boxing of primitive types like String and Int. As VOC is written half in Python, half in Java, a single integer can be found in various representations on its way through the compiler -- as a Python object, unboxed to a primitive Java int, then packaged back up to a Python object. This problem was (somewhat incoherently) addressed in my proposal, but ultimately we couldn't come up with a good abstraction to support it.</li>
<li>Build a peephole optimizer. <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Python/peephole.c">CPython's peephole optimizer</a> scans generated bytecode to identify sequences of bytecode that can be optimized, VOC could benefit from this too.</li>
<li>Hook up more benchmarks, which serve as both proof of the kinds of programs VOC can currently compile and areas ripe for performance improvement.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Thank you</h2>
<p>I will wrap this up by giving big thanks to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/freakboy3742">Russ</a>, my mentor. The time you spent helping
me form my ideas, patiently answering my questions and reviewing my work was invaluable
to me. It couldn't have been easy keeping up with what I was doing especially since I
started improvising halfway through the summer. I am so grateful for your help, thank you.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2018 has come to an end. During the three months long coding period, I have contributed several patches in VOC repository of BeeWare, all working towards the ultimate end goal of running <cite>asyncio</cite> module in VOC. In this blog post (which is my first actual blog post by the way 😄), I will document what I have done so far, why I couldn't make it to the end goal (yea, unfortunately I couldn't get <cite>asyncio</cite> to work at the end of GSoC 2018), and what's left that needs to be done in order to achieve the end goal (or at least make part of <cite>asyncio</cite> work).</p>
<div class="section" id="building-foundation">
<h2>Building Foundation</h2>
<p>The first error that the transpiler throws when attempting to compile <cite>asyncio</cite> module was &quot;No handler for <cite>YieldFrom</cite>&quot;, so it makes sense to start from this issue first.</p>
<p>Another feature related to generator was <cite>Yield</cite> expression. Before GSoC 2018, <cite>Yield</cite> statement in VOC was just a statement, meaning <cite>yield</cite> could not be used as expression. Generator methods such as <cite>generator.send</cite>, <cite>generator.throw</cite> and <cite>generator.close</cite> were not supported as well. Those features are what make asynchronous programming with generator possible, so I spent a few weeks to extend generator functionality in VOC, laying down the path to <cite>asyncio</cite> module.</p>
<p>PRs related to generator are listed below:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/voc/pull/821">PR #821</a> : Added support for Yield from statement (merged)</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/voc/pull/823">PR #823</a> : Added generator send method (merged)</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/voc/pull/831">PR #831</a> : Support exceptions handling in generator (merged)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="nonlocal-statement">
<h2>Nonlocal Statement</h2>
<p><cite>Nonlocal</cite> statement was another syntax not supported by VOC. After completion of generator's features, implementing this is the next step towards compiling <cite>asyncio</cite> module.</p>
<p>Implementing this feature took about 3 ~ 4 weeks as this is not as trivial as it seems. I took several approaches on this, while some of them do work, the code is not pretty and <cite>hacky</cite>, which could come back to bite me/other contributors in the long run. After many discussions with Russell, I refactored the closure mechanism in VOC and took a much cleaner approach in <cite>nonlocal</cite> implementations. I must admit that I took some short-cuts for the sake of &quot;making nonlocal works&quot; in the process of implementing <cite>nonlocal</cite> statement, resulting in poor design and messy codes. Many thanks to Russell, who helped me to improve my coding style and told me not to be discouraged when I'm stuck. 😄</p>

<div class="section" id="the-collections-module">
<h2>The Collections Module</h2>
<p>Next item on my hit list was pure Java implementations of the <cite>collections</cite> module. <cite>asyncio</cite> module depends on 3 data structures from <cite>collections</cite>, namely <cite>defauldict</cite>, <cite>Deque</cite> and <cite>OrderedDict</cite>. Two of them (<cite>defaultdict</cite> and <cite>Deque</cite>) are implemented in C in CPython, plus they have good analog in Java, so it makes senses to implement the module in Java. Porting <cite>defauldict</cite>, <cite>Deque</cite> and <cite>OrderedDict</cite> to Java in VOC is relatively straight-forward, taking about 1.5 weeks to complete.</p>

<h2>Towards The Ultimate End Goal</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, three months of GSoC coding period was not enough for me to bring <cite>asyncio</cite> module to VOC. The nonlocal statement implementation was the biggest blocker for me mainly because I didn't think thoroughly before writing code. If I were to plan carefully and lay out a general coding direction, I would've completed it in much shorter time and have time for other implementations. An advice for the aspiring and upcoming GSoC-er, don't rush your code, make sure you know 100% about what you're doing before diving into the codes.</p>
<p>With that said, following are the list of modules to be implemented/ported to Java before <cite>asyncio</cite> will work in VOC:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><cite>socket</cite> module (a bit tricky since Java doesn't support Unix domain socket natively)</li>
<li><cite>selectors</cite> module (high level I/O operations)</li>
<li><cite>threading</cite> module (might be easier to implement this first since threading in Python is an emulation of Java's Thread)</li>
<li><cite>time</cite> module (partially implemented in VOC)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Huge thanks to my mentor, Russell Keith-Magee for accepting my proposal, providing guidance and encouraging me when things didn't go as intended. It is truly an honor to be a part of the BeeWare community. I had a blast contributing to BeeWare project, and I'm sure I will stick around as a regular contributor.
Also shout out to the BeeWare community for answering my queries and reviewing my pull requests. 😄</p>

<p>Cuando diseñas una aplicación de interfaz gráfica, ya sea para escritorio, dispositivos móviles o navegador, una de las tareas más fundamentales es describir cómo colocar widgets en la pantalla. La mayoría de los kits de herramientas de widgets usarán un modelo de empaquetamiento de cuadrícula o caja de algún tipo para resolver este problema. Estos modelos tienden a ser relativamente fáciles al comienzo, pero se desmoronan rápidamente cuando tienes necesidades complejas de diseño o cuando tienes diseños que necesitan adaptarse a diferentes tamaños de pantalla.</p>
<p>En lugar de inventar un nuevo modelo de cuadrícula o de caja, el kit de herramientas del widget <a class="reference external" href="https://toga.readthedocs.io">Toga</a> widget toolkit adopta un enfoque diferente, utilizando un esquema conocido para diseñar contenido: <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">Cascading Style Sheets</a>, o CSS. Aunque CSS es más conocido por especificar el diseño en las páginas web, no hay nada intrínsecamente específico de la web al respecto. Al final del día, es un sistema para describir el diseño de una colección jerárquica de nodos de contenido. Sin embargo, hasta la fecha, cada implementación de CSS está vinculada a un navegador, por lo que la percepción es que CSS es un estándar específico del navegador.</p>
<p>Ahí es donde entra <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/colosseum">Colosseum</a>. Colosseum es una implementación independiente del navegador de un motor de renderizado CSS. Toma un árbol de &quot;nodos&quot; de contenido, como un DOM de un documento HTML y aplica instrucciones de diseño CSS para diseñar esos nodos como cuadros en la pantalla. En el caso de Toga, en lugar de diseñar los elementos <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;div&gt;</tt> y <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;span&gt;</tt>, diseñas objetos Box y Button. Esto le permite especificar diseños adaptativos increíblemente complejos para aplicaciones Toga.</p>
<p>Pero Colosseum como proyecto tiene muchos otros posibles usos. Se puede usar en cualquier lugar donde exista la necesidad de describir el diseño <em>fuera</em> del contexto de un navegador. Por ejemplo, Colosseum podría ser la piedra angular de un renderizador de HTML a PDF <em>que no requiere</em> el uso de un navegador. También podría usarse como una librería de pruebas e implementación de referencia para la especificación CSS en sí misma, proporcionando una forma ligera de codificar y probar los cambios propuestos a la especificación.</p>
<p>La implementación actual se basa en el proyecto de Facebook <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/facebook/yoga">yoga</a>: originalmente era un código portado de JavaScript a Python línea a línea. Sin embargo, yoga solo implementa la sección de Flexbox de la especificación CSS3.</p>
<p>Esta semana, comenzamos un gran proyecto: reescribir Colosseum para que sea un motor de CSS totalmente compatible. El trabajo hasta ahora se puede encontrar en <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/colosseum/tree/globe">la rama globo del repositorio Colosseum en Github</a>. El primer objetivo es el cumplimiento de CSS2.1, con una implementación del modelo de caja de CSS tradicional y el diseño de flujo. Una vez que tengamos una implementación razonable de eso, buscaremos agregar diseños Grid y FlexBox desde el conjunto de especificaciones CSS3.</p>
<p>Esto es obviamente un trabajo grande. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/#css-levels">CSS es una gran especificación</a>, por lo que hay mucho trabajo por hacer, ¡pero eso también significa que hay muchos lugares para contribuir! Elije un párrafo de la especificación CSS, construye algunos casos de prueba que demuestren los casos descritos en ese párrafo y envía un parche que implemente ese comportamiento!</p>
<p>Esto resalta por que tu apoyo financiero es muy importante. Si bien <em>podríamos</em>  hacer esto completamente con un esfuerzo voluntario, vamos a progresar mucho más rápido si un pequeño grupo de personas pudiera enfocarse en este proyecto de tiempo completo. El apoyo financiero permitiría aumentar significativamente la velocidad de desarrollo de Colosseum y el resto de la suite BeeWare.</p>
<p>Si deseas que Colosseum y el resto de BeeWare se desarrollen hasta el punto en que puedan utilizarse para aplicaciones comerciales, considera apoyar a BeeWare financieramente. Y si tienes alguna idea para fuentes de financiación potenciales más grandes, por favor <a class="reference external" href="mailto:russell&#64;keith-magee.com">ponte en contacto</a>.</p>

  <p>Después de casi 4 meses de trabajo en <a class="reference external" href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/">Google Summer of Code</a> 2017, finalmente estoy completando mi propuesta. Cada migración de widget y cada commit / PR / Issues / discusión con mis mentores sobre <a class="reference external" href="/project/projects/tools/cricket/">Cricket</a>, <a class="reference external" href="/project/projects/libraries/toga/">Toga</a> y <a class="reference external" href="/project/projects/bridges/rubicon/">rubicon-objc</a> fueron detallados en el <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/cricket/issues/58">Issue 58</a>.</p>

<p>La mejor manera de demostrar que un producto es confiable para los clientes es usarlo. Por lo tanto, la forma de demostrar que <a class="reference external" href="/project/projects/libraries/toga/">Toga</a> es una herramienta eficaz para construir una interfaz gráfica de usuario es construir una aplicación completa que la utilice.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="/project/projects/tools/cricket/">Cricket</a> es una herramienta gráfica que le ayuda a ejecutar sus suites de prueba. Su versión actual se implementa utilizando <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/tkinter.html">Tkinter</a> como el marco de la interfaz gráfica principal. Entonces, ¿por qué no probar <a class="reference external" href="/project/projects/libraries/toga/">Toga</a> dentro de otro producto de <a class="reference external" href="/es/">BeeWare</a>? Eso es lo que he logrado durante mi trabajo de GSoC.</p>

<div class="section" id="resultados">
<h2>Resultados</h2>
<p>La propuesta se centra no sólo en el puerto de <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/tkinter.html">Tkinter</a> a <a class="reference external" href="/project/projects/libraries/toga/">Toga</a>, sino en la asignación de los widgets necesarios para una aplicación real utilizando <a class="reference external" href="/project/projects/libraries/toga/">Toga</a>. Para ayudarme a mapear esto he estudiado más sobre <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/tkinter.html">Tkinter</a>, <a class="reference external" href="/project/projects/libraries/toga/">Toga</a>, <a class="reference external" href="/es/proyecto/proyectos/librerias/colosseum/">Colosseum</a>, <a class="reference external" href="/project/projects/bridges/rubicon/">rubicon-objc</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec">Objective-C</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/General/Conceptual/DevPedia-CocoaCore/Cocoa.html">Cocoa</a> y <a class="reference external" href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/">CSS</a>.</p>
<p>El trabajo que hice durante GSoC se envió a través del <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/cricket/pull/65">PR 65</a>, el informe en el <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/cricket/issues/58">Issue 58</a> y la demostración final se puede ver en este <a class="reference external" href="https://youtu.be/5kz_CmQYFYE">link</a>. Había widgets utilizados en <a class="reference external" href="/project/projects/tools/cricket/">Cricket</a> que no estaban listos todavía en <a class="reference external" href="/project/projects/libraries/toga/">Toga</a>, por lo que era necesario hacer algunas mejoras en <a class="reference external" href="/project/projects/libraries/toga/">Toga</a> para que pudiera usarlas en <a class="reference external" href="/project/projects/tools/cricket/">Cricket</a>.

  <p>Con el programa Google Summer of Code 2017 llegando a su fin, es hora de resumir lo que hice durante el verano trabajando en Batavia.</p>
<p>Batavia es una parte de la colección de proyectos de BeeWare. Como todavía está en su primera etapa de desarrollo, por mi parte me ofreció implementar una serie de características que faltaban en Batavia, que van desde tipos de datos elementales, a través de la manipulación JSON y construcciones de lenguaje como generadores. Publiqué mi propuesta en <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/batavia/issues/483">este hilo de GitHub</a> y lo mantuve actualizado con mi progreso semanalmente.</p>
<p>Ten en cuenta que al final de GSoC, hemos decidido divergir de la propuesta inicial y renunciar a la aplicación de <cite>contextlib</cite> en favor de la compatibilidad con Python 3.6, que usa op-codes de 2 bytes.</p>
<p>En general, fue una gran experiencia de aprendizaje y diversión. Muchas gracias a mis mentores Russell Keith-Magee y Katie McLaughlin, y a toda la comunidad de BeeWare.</p>

  <p>Google Summer of Code 2017 está llegando a su fin. Después de tres meses de trabajo en el proyecto BeeWare, quisiera resumir mi trabajo y compartir mis experiencias.</p>
<div class="section" id="ningun-plan-de-batalla-sobrevive-al-primer-contacto">
<h2>&quot;Ningún plan de batalla sobrevive al primer contacto&quot;.</h2>
<p>Esta fue una de las primeras cosas que Russell me dijo después de que decidimos fundamentalmente reestructurar mi <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/118">calendario y metas de GSoC propuestos</a>. Durante el período inicial con la comunidad descubrimos que Toga era aún más difícil de probar como esperábamos. El estrecho acoplamiento entre el código independiente de la plataforma en  Toga-Core y las implementaciones dependientes de la plataforma para (Windows, MacOS, iOS, Linux, Android, Django, ...) nos estaba dando problemas para escribir pruebas significativas.</p>
<p>Esperamos que Toga se convierta en un proyecto de tamaño decente, por lo tanto queremos que tenga una base sólida y bien probada. Por esta razón, decidimos que pasaría la mayor parte de GSoC para reestructurar Toga para que ejecutar pruebas resultara más fácil de hacer. Además de eso, también añadiría pruebas de implementación para comprobar si un backend dado se implementa de la manera correcta. Si terminara antes del final del verano, empezaría con mi propuesta de proyecto original.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="la-gran-reestructuracion-de-toga">
<h2>La gran reestructuración de Toga</h2>
<p>Con los nuevos objetivos y una nueva rama comencé el viaje para reestructurar el proyecto Toga para hacerlo más fácil de probar.</p>
<p>Después de hackear y probar diferentes cosas en una <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Ocupe/restruc_toga">rama separada</a>. Identifiqué que las dependencias entrelazadas de la plataforma son el problema principal. Para separar el módulo Toga-Core de sus implementaciones de backend decidimos usar el patrón de fábrica en lugar del modelo de herencia que teníamos antes. Ahora cada backend tiene su propia fábrica que produce los widgets adecuados para la plataforma en la que se está ejecutando. De esta manera tenemos una clara separación entre Toga-Core y el nivel de implementación. Las dependencias de la plataforma ahora están incluidas en el nivel de implementación.</p>
<p>Después de que la nueva estructura fuera clara porté Toga-Core así como los backends para el Cocoa, iOS y GTK. Hice esto en la rama de Toga <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/185">(La gran reestructuración de Toga [WIP] # 185)</a>.</p>
<p>En la práctica, esto significaba que tenía que tocar manualmente casi todos los widgets de todos los backends para conectarlos al nuevo patrón de fábrica.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="desafios">
<h2>Desafíos</h2>
<p>Toga habla con los frameworks nativos GUI, por lo tanto tuve que tener un buen entendimiento acerca de los principios y conceptos detrás de cada uno de estos marcos. A veces me sentía abrumado por la complejidad combinada de todas las partes que componen Toga. La siguiente es la lista:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Cada backend de Toga se envuelve alrededor de un marco existente y único. Para envolver el marco que tiene que entender el marco.</li>
<li>&quot;Me encanta Python, ¿por qué tengo que entender Objetive C&quot;? Para trabajar eficazmente en los backends de iOS y macOS, tenía que aprender los conceptos básicos del Objetivo C, aunque sólo fuera para leer los documentos de Apple.</li>
<li>Toga tiene un montón de partes móviles. Hay backends, marcos, librerías para hablar con backends, librerías para realizar el diseño de la interfaz de usuario y más. Me tomó una buena cantidad de tiempo para entender todas estas partes. Lo siguiente es sólo una visión general de los conocimientos recién adquiridos durante GSoC:</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc">Rubicon-ObjC</a> para hablar con los backends de iOS y macOS.</li>

  <p>Escribir suites de pruebas es una habilidad que es una parte vital del entrenamiento de los programadores. Aprender a escribir buenas pruebas le ayuda a escribir un código más robusto y asegura que cuando haya escrito un código que funcione, siga trabajando durante mucho tiempo en el futuro. También puede ayudarle a escribir mejor código en primer lugar. Resulta que el código bien diseñado, con alta cohesión y bajo acoplamiento, también es fácil de probar - por lo que escribir código que sea fácil de probar casi siempre dará como resultado una mejor calidad total del código.</p>
<p>Un paso importante en la &quot;nivelación&quot; de su experiencia de pruebas es comenzar a usar un servicio de integración continua o CI. Un servicio de CI es una herramienta que ejecuta automáticamente su suite de pruebas cada vez que alguien realiza un cambio o cada vez que alguien propone un cambio en forma de una solicitud de PR. El uso de un servicio de CI garantiza que su código <em>siempre</em> pase su suite de pruebas - no puede introducirse accidentalmente en un cambio que rompe una prueba, porque obtendrá una notificación de advertencia roja grande.</p>
<p>Un CI es un servicio tan importante que muchas empresas sólo existen para proporcionar CI-as-a-service. El proyecto BeeWare ha utilizado, para diversos proyectos, <a class="reference external" href="https://travis-ci.com">TravisCI</a> y <a class="reference external" href="https://circleci.com">CircleCI</a>. Ambas herramientas proporcionan niveles gratuitos para proyectos de código abierto y han patrocinado generosamente BeeWare con actualizaciones de capacidad en varias ocasiones.</p>
<p>Sin embargo, BeeWare ha tenido una relación interesante con los servicios comerciales de CI. Esto es por dos razones.</p>
<p>En primer lugar, nuestros conjuntos de pruebas, especialmente para <a class="reference external" href="/es/proyecto/proyectos/puentes/voc">VOC</a> y <a class="reference external" href="/es/proyecto/proyectos/puentes/batavia">Batavia</a> - toman mucho tiempo para ejecutarse. Estos dos proyectos requieren pruebas que inician y cierran repetidamente las máquinas virtuales (para Java y JavaScript, respectivamente), y no importa cuánto se optimice el código que se está probando, el tiempo de inicio y apagado de una máquina virtual eventualmente se acumula. También necesitamos ejecutar nuestras suites de prueba en múltiples versiones de Python - en la actualidad, soportamos Python 3.4, 3.5 y 3.6, con 3.7 en el horizonte. También hay cambios sutiles en versiones micro que pueden requerir pruebas.</p>
<p>Hemos sido capaces de acelerar las prueba, dividiendo la suite de pruebas y ejecutando partes de la suite en paralelo, pero eso nos obliga a enfrentarnos al segundo problema. Los servicios comerciales de CI suelen operar en un modelo de suscripción; mayores suscripciones que proporcionan más recursos simultáneos. Sin embargo, nuestro patrón de uso es muy inusual. La mayor parte del año, recibimos un goteo lento de solicitudes de PRs que requieren pruebas. Sin embargo, un par de veces al año, tenemos un gran sprint, y tenemos una avalancha de contribuciones durante un corto período de tiempo. En PyCon EE.UU., hemos tenido grupos de 40 personas presentando parches - y todos ellos necesitan sus PRs probados por CI. Y el tiempo es un factor - los sprints sólo duran un par de días, por lo que un rápido cambio en las pruebas es esencial.</p>
<p>Si tuviéramos que suscribir a los niveles de suscripción de nivel superior de CircleCi y TravisCI, todavía no tendríamos suficientes recursos para soportar un sprint - pero estaríamos <em>masivamente</em> sobre abastecidos en recursos durante el resto del año. También tendríamos que pagar $ 750 o más por mes por este servicio, que es un presupuesto que no podemos permitirnos.</p>
<p>Así que tuvimos un problema. Para ejecutar nuestra suite de pruebas de manera eficaz, necesitábamos recursos paralelizados masivamente para ejecutar una suite de pruebas rápidamente; y en ciertas épocas del año, necesitamos un número extremadamente grande de estos recursos.</p>
<p>También teníamos otras tareas automatizadas que queríamos realizar. Queríamos hacer linting del código (comprobación automatizada de estilo de código) antes de que se probara un PR. Queríamos verificar la ortografía de la documentación. Y queríamos que estas tareas se retroalimentaran en GitHub como comentarios automatizados y marcadores de estado de revisión de código específicos, informando a los colaboradores no sólo de que se había producido un problema, sino de qué problema y dónde estaban en su código.</p>
<p>También queríamos administrar las compilaciones de pipeline - no tiene sentido hacer una prueba completa de varias versiones de Python una vez que haya establecido que las pruebas están fallando en una versión. Y no hay punto en hacer pruebas <em>en absoluto</em> si hay problemas de estilo de código.</p>
<p>También queríamos hacer cosas que no eran sólo pruebas. Queríamos verificar que se firmaron acuerdos de contribución. Queríamos automatizar el despliegue de sitios web y documentación.</p>
<p>Lo que teníamos no era sólo un problema de CI. Era un problema donde queríamos ejecutar automáticamente código arbitrario, de manera segura, en respuesta a un evento GitHub.</p>
<p>He estado tratando de encontrar un servicio de CI que pueda satisfacer nuestras necesidades durante más de un año. Pero durante el último año, algunos pensamientos comenzaron a congelarse en mi cabeza.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Amazon proporciona una API (EC2) que le permite arrancar máquinas de complejidad variable (hasta 64 CPUs, con casi 500 GB de RAM) y pagar por minuto para ese uso.</li>
<li>Docker proporciona las herramientas para configurar, lanzar y ejecutar código de manera aislada</li>
<li>Amazon también proporciona una API (ECS) para controlar la ejecución de los contenedores Docker.</li>
</ul>
<p>No hay nada específico acerca de AWS EC2 o ECS tampoco - se podría utilizar Linode y Kubernetes, o Docker Swarm o Microsoft Azure ... simplemente se necesita tener la capacidad de filtrar fácilmente las máquinas y ejecutar un contenedor Docker. Después de todo: un conjunto de pruebas es sólo un contenedor Docker que ejecuta un script que inicia su suite de pruebas. Una revisión de linting es un contenedor de Docker que ejecuta un script que lints su código. Una verificación de acuerdo de contribuyente es un contenedor de Docker que comprueba los metadatos asociados con una solicitud de extracción.</p>
<p>Todo lo que necesita es un sitio web que puede recibir las notificaciones de eventos de GitHub e iniciar los contenedores de Docker en respuesta.</p>
<p>A principios de julio, me encontré entre trabajos, y pronuncié la fatídica pregunta: &quot;¿Cuán difícil podría ser?&quot; Y así, hoy, estoy anunciando <a class="reference external" href="/es/proyecto/proyectos/herramientas/beekeeper">BeeKeeper</a> - el propio servicio de CI de BeeWare.</p>
<p>BeeKeeper se despliega como un sitio web de Heroku, escrito con Django. Después de configurarlo con las credenciales de Github y AWS, escucha los webhooks de Github. Cuando se detecta una solicitud de pull o Push, BeeKeeper crea una solicitud de generación; que la solicitud de construcción inspecciona el código en el repositorio en busca de un archivo de configuración <tt class="docutils literal">beekeeper.yml</tt>. Ese archivo de configuración describe el pipeline de tareas que se van a realizar, y para cada tarea, el tipo de máquina que se debe usar, las variables de entorno que se requieran y la imagen de Docker que se utilizará.</p>
<p>BeeKeeper también permite al administrador del sitio describir qué recursos se utilizarán para satisfacer las compilaciones. Una tarea puede decir que necesita una instancia de &quot;Alta CPU&quot;; pero la instancia BeeKeeper puede determinar lo que significa &quot;alta CPU&quot; - ¿es 4 CPUs o 32? ¿Cuándo esas máquinas son coladas hacia arriba, cuánto tiempo se les permitirá sentarse inactivo antes de ser apagado de nuevo? ¿Cuántas máquinas deben estar permanentemente en el grupo de trabajo? ¿Y cuál es el límite superior de las máquinas que se iniciará?</p>
<p>Una herramienta complementaria para BeeKeeper es <a class="reference external" href="/es/proyecto/proyectos/atico/waggle">Waggle</a>. Waggle es una herramienta que prepara una definición local de una tarea para que pueda ser utilizada por BeeKeeper - compila la imagen de Docker y la carga en ECS para que pueda ser referenciada por tareas. (Se llama &quot;Waggle&quot; porque cuando las abejas obreras descubren una buena fuente de néctar, regresan a la colmena y hacen una 'danza' que le dice a otras abejas cómo hacer para encontrar esa fuente).</p>
<p>También hemos proporcionado un repositorio llamado <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/comb">Comb</a> (nombrado después del peine de miel, las abejas del lugar almacenan todo el néctar que encuentran) que define las configuraciones de la tarea que una instancia de BeeKeeper puedo usar. Hemos proporcionado algunas definiciones simples como parte del repositorio base de Comb; cada implementación de BeeKeeper debe tener uno de estos repositorios propios.</p>
<p>Todavía hay mucho trabajo por hacer, pero ya estamos usando BeeKeeper con Batavia y VOC, y la próxima PyCon AU sprints será nuestra primera en condiciones de alta carga. Algunos cálculos de respaldo prevén que por alrededor de $50, podremos proporcionar suficientes recursos de CPU para cada ejecución de prueba para completar su ejecución en 10 minutos o menos, soportando un sprint de decenas de personas.</p>
<p>Aunque BeeKeeper fue escrito para satisfacer las necesidades del proyecto BeeWare, es una herramienta de código abierto disponible para cualquier persona. Si desea tomar BeeKeeper para darle una prueba, vaya a los sprints, o <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/beekeeper">revise el código en GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>BeeKeeper también es un ejemplo del tipo de producto que vería más si el desarrollo de BeeWare se financiara a tiempo completo. Fui capaz de construir BeeKeeper porque tenía un par de semanas de descanso entre los trabajos. No hay fin para las herramientas y bibliotecas como BeeKeeper y Waggle que podrían ser construidas para soportar el proceso de desarrollo de software - todo lo que falta son los recursos necesarios para desarrollar esas herramientas. Si desea ver más herramientas como BeeKeeper en el mundo, considere la posibilidad de unirse al proyecto BeeWare como <a class="reference external" href="/es/contribuir/membresia/">miembro financiero</a>. Cada pedacito ayuda, y si podemos alcanzar a una masa crítica de patrocinadores, podré comenzar a trabajar en BeeWare a tiempo completo.</p>

  <p>Hace unos 4 años, hice el primer <em>commit</em> con <a class="reference external" href="/es/proyecto/proyectos/herramientas/cricket/">Cricket</a> - la primera herramienta que eventualmente se convertiría en parte de la suite BeeWare. Desde entonces, el proyecto BeeWare ha crecido para abarcar soporte para plataformas móviles, dos implementaciones alternativas de Python y un conjunto de widgets multi-plataforma, así como las herramientas de desarrollo que iniciaron el proyecto originalmente.</p>
<p>Durante la mayor parte de este tiempo, BeeWare ha sido un esfuerzo voluntario. Inicialmente, fue un proyecto en solitario; sin embargo, en el último año en particular, el número de personas que han contribuido a BeeWare ha crecido rápidamente. Más de 300 personas han hecho contribuciones a las diversas herramientas y librerías de BeeWare, debido, al menos en parte, a las <a class="reference external" href="/es/contribuir/monedas-de-desafio/">Monedas de Desafío</a> que hemos estado ofreciendo en los sprints.</p>
<p>Cabe destacar el <a class="reference external" href="/es/comunidad/equipo/">equipo de 7 personas</a> que se han unido al proyecto como apicultores, ayudando a compartir la carga de mantenimiento del proyecto. No puedo agradecer a estas personas lo suficiente - sin su ayuda, no se habría logrado tanto progreso durante el último año.</p>
<p>Tu debes haber notado que en los últimos meses, el progreso ha sido especialmente rápido. Esto se debe a que, durante los últimos seis meses, el desarrollo de BeeWare ha sido parcialmente financiado por empleadores muy complacientes en <a class="reference external" href="https://www.jambonsw.com">Jambon Software</a>. Mi contrato con Jambon me permitió pasar largos periodos de tiempo pagados para trabajar en BeeWare - y, no es sorprendente, es posible hacer un enorme progreso como resultado. Los últimos 6 meses han visto:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Amplias mejoras a Batavia y VOC;</li>
<li>Un backend Android para Toga;</li>
<li>Un backend de Django para Toga, permitiendo que las aplicaciones de Toga se implementen como aplicaciones web;</li>
<li>Un backend de Winforms para Toga, permitiendo que las aplicaciones de Toga funcionen en Windows con un aspecto moderno;</li>
</ul>
<p>Desafortunadamente, mi contrato con Jambon está llegando a su fin - lo que significa que mis contribuciones a BeeWare volverán a ser lo que mi tiempo libre permite.</p>
<p>Esto también significa que la tasa de progreso también se ralentizará. Todavía hay mucho por hacer: hay un montón de la librería estándar de Python para portar a Batavia y VOC; Toga necesita un mucho más amplio soporte de widgets; Colosseum necesita ser extendido para que sea compatible con el modelo de caja CSS completo, no sólo CSS3 Flexbox; y las herramientas que lo iniciaron todo - Cricket, Bugjar, Duvet, y otros - todos necesitan ser portados a Toga.</p>
<p>Me <em>gustaría</em> poder trabajar en BeeWare a tiempo completo. Sin embargo, la simple realidad es que a menos que pueda encontrar una manera de pagar por este trabajo, sólo será capaz de contribuir en mi tiempo libre.</p>
<p>Así que - esto es un llamado para ti - la comunidad de Python. Si estás entusiasmado con la perspectiva de tener acceso a Python en plataformas móviles, o te gustaría escribir aplicaciones en Python que tengan interfaces de usuario completamente nativas - <strong>Necesito tu ayuda</strong>.</p>
<p>Por sólo <strong>US $ 10 al mes</strong>, puedes <a class="reference external" href="/es/contribuir/membresia/">unirte al proyecto BeeWare como miembro</a> y ayudar a que este sueño se convierta en realidad. Si puedo encontrar 1000 personas en la comunidad de Python que quieran estas herramientas y estén dispuestos a apoyar financieramente su desarrollo, puedo comenzar a trabajar en BeeWare a tiempo completo. Por supuesto, este objetivo es aún más fácil si las empresas se involucran y patrocinan en los niveles más altos.</p>
<p>Si puedo encontrar a <em>más</em> de 1000 personas, entonces mucho más es posible. La opción obvia sería contratar a otros desarrolladores con experiencia para ayudar con el trabajo. La idea de tener a otros para compartir ideas durante el proceso de desarrollo es muy atractiva. Sin embargo, también podemos usar esto como una oportunidad para hacer un bien social.</p>
<p>Durante algún tiempo, he tenido una <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/PyBeeWare/status/784545607402852352">oferta abierta para ser mentor</a> a cualquiera que quiera involucrarse con la contribución de Coódigo Abierto usando el proyecto BeeWare. Sin embargo, no mucha gente ha podido tomar seriamente esta oferta, porque el tiempo requerido para tomar seriamente la oferta es prohibitivo. Me gustaría poder extender mi oferta a algo más que una relación casual de tutoría. Me gustaría poder contratar - y pagar - uno o más desarrolladores junior para el proyecto BeeWare, y enfocarme en dar esa oportunidad a personas de demografía subrepresentada.</p>
<p>Aún son los primeros días para BeeWare. El apoyo financiero significa un progreso más rápido. Más widgets. Mejor documentación. Más de todo lo que has visto hasta ahora de BeeWare. Si puedo encontrar financiación a tiempo completo para mí -o mejor aún, para mí y para un equipo pequeño-, no tengo dudas de que la suite BeeWare se convertirá en una alternativa viable para proyectos comerciales en muy poco tiempo. Lo mejor de todo, seremos capaces de hacer esto sin tener que renunciar a los ideales del movimiento de código abierto.</p>
<p>Estoy emocionado por lo que le depara el futuro a BeeWare. Espero que nos acompañes en este viaje.</p>
<p>(Y si tu estás pensando en registrarte, y vienes a PyCon US en Portland este mes de mayo, déjame dejar una pista suave ... inscríbete ahora. Vale la pena #cryptic)</p>

  <p>En PyCon AU 2015, y de nuevo en DjangoCon US 2015, di una charla titulada &quot;Dinero, dinero, dinero: Escribiendo software, en un mundo de hombres ricos&quot;. La charla fue un resumen de los problemas relacionados con uno de los mayores problemas que veo frente a la comunidad de código abierto: cómo proporcionar los recursos que se necesitan para desarrollar y mantener el software del que nosotros, como comunidad, dependemos. Esto significa proporcionar mantenimiento y apoyo a proyectos establecidos, grandes y pequeños; sino que también proporciona un ecosistema donde las nuevas ideas pueden ser incubadas, desarrolladas y maduradas hasta que presenten alternativas atractivas o beneficios significativos sobre las ofertas de fuentes cerradas.</p>
<p>Han pasado casi 18 meses desde que presenté esta charla, pero el problema persiste. No he estado solo al notar y llamar la atención sobre este asunto, tampoco. <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/nayafia">Nadia Eghbal</a> fue encargada de redactar un libro para la Fundación Ford titulado <a class="reference external" href="http://www.fordfoundation.org/library/reports-and-studies/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure">Caminos y puentes</a> resaltando las necesidades crónicas en infraestructura que subyacen a gran parte de la economía moderna. Eric Holscher (mantenedor de <a class="reference external" href="https://readthedocs.com">Read the Docs</a>) <a class="reference external" href="http://ericholscher.com/blog/2016/aug/31/funding-oss-marketing-money/">escribió sobre los problemas que tuvo para recaudar fondos</a>, a pesar de que el servicio que él ofrece corresponde a una parte ampliamente utilizada - posiblemente indispensable - del ecosistema Python.</p>
<p>Sin embargo, a pesar de esta atención, todavía no llega a estar tan cerca de la atención que debería tener. Y es una cuestión que es de gran importancia para mí, ya que el proyecto BeeWare está buscando formas de financiar el desarrollo necesario para pasar de una &quot;interesante demostración técnica&quot; a una &quot;solución técnica convincente&quot;.</p>
<p>Hace unos meses, se sugirió que publicara una entrada en el blog para acompañar la presentación del video. Me arrastré los pies al hacer esto, hasta que el trabajador colaborador de BeeWare y simpático chico 'Elias Dorneles' se ofreció a tomar mis notas y convertirla en una transcripción.</p>
<p>Así que aquí está. Dinero, Dinero, Dinero: Escribiendo software, en un mundo de hombres ricos.

<h2>Transcripción</h2>
<p>Hola, soy Russell Keith-Magee, si ya has oído hablar de mí, probablemente sea por mi trabajo en el proyecto Django; He sido un miembro del equipo central durante casi 10 años, y presidente de la Fundación de Software Django desde 2011.</p>
<p>Uno de los grandes retos del proyecto Django - y cualquier gran proyecto para el caso - ha sido asegurar la seguridad de su desarrollo futuro.</p>
<p>Mi trabajo diario es como CTO y co-fundador de TradesCloud. Somos un software como servicio para los comerciantes - plomeros, electricistas, carpinteros y similares. TradesCloud depende de una serie de proyectos de código abierto - Django, Apache, memcache, muchos otros. Así que tengo un interés comercial en la continuidad de estos proyectos de código abierto - pero ciertamente no tengo los recursos para financiarlos a <em>todos</em> por mí mismo.</p>
<p>También tengo un interés declarado en los problemas de interfaces gráficas, especialmente en lo que se refiere a las herramientas de desarrollo. Tengo grandes visiones de lo que <em>me gustaría</em> hacer con este proyecto, y he recibido algunas grandes contribuciones de la comunidad, pero todavía es en gran medida mi propio trabajo. Mi start-up  sería capaz de hacer un gran uso de estas herramientas si estuvieran maduras.</p>
<p>También soy un mantenedor de algunos proyectos más pequeños, como el envoltorio Python para la API Xero. Comencé el proyecto porque tenía una picazón. Pero ahora he abierto el proyecto, lo que significa que he heredado una tarea de mantenimiento. He aceptado la ayuda de un par de personas - sobre todo Matthew Schinkel y Aidan Lister, que han hecho un gran trabajo. Pero si soy honesto, la carga de mantenimiento de PyXero excede el tiempo que puedo dedicarle razonablemente.</p>
<p>Entonces, tengo intereses creados en el software libre. Tengo un interés como productor de un proyecto exitoso con un alto perfil; como productor de un pequeño proyecto con muchos usuarios pero poco incentivo personal; y como productor de proyectos más pequeños con casi ningún perfil pero grandes planes. Todos estos proyectos tienen diferentes necesidades de recursos, reflejando su madurez como proyectos.</p>
<p>También tengo intereses como consumidor de software libre, tanto en términos de software en el que confío para desarrollar mis propios proyectos, como en términos de mi interés comercial en el mantenimiento a largo plazo de herramientas y plataformas. Necesito estos proyectos para seguir desarrollándose, sobrevivir y prosperar.</p>
<p>Sobre la base de mi experiencia, me gustaría hacer una audaz afirmación:</p>
<blockquote class="pull-quote">
A falta de otras limitaciones, dados recursos equivalentes, el enfoque de software libre produce resultados de ingeniería mucho mayores que el enfoque de código cerrado.</blockquote>
<p>La frase clave es &quot;dado recursos equivalentes&quot;. La mayoría de los proyectos de software libre no se desarrollan usando nada cercano a recursos &quot;equivalentes&quot;.</p>
<p>En algunos casos, esto es una bendición disfrazada - sin importar el proyecto, tener escasos recursos es un excelente crisol para quemar lo innecesario y dejar sólo el metal base. Pero no siempre es una bendición.</p>
<div class="section" id="el-camino-moral-alto-esta-lleno-de-cadaveres-de-nuestros-aliados">
<h3>El camino moral alto está lleno de cadáveres de nuestros aliados</h3>
<p>Hable con cualquier desarrollador de software libre prominente, y entre las historias de éxito, también escuchará algunos problemas consistentes - que tienen grandes ideas y grandes planes, pero no hay tiempo para ejecutarlas; que están a punto de quemarse debido a las presiones de mantener su proyecto; o que han tenido otra discusión de lista de correo con alguien que no entiende por qué no dejo todo para ayudarles a solucionar su problema. Y hay muchos ejemplos.</p>
<p>OpenSSL es el software que maneja prácticamente todas las conexiones &quot;seguras&quot; en Internet, y sin embargo, solo hasta el descubrimiento de Heartbleed -una vulnerabilidad crítica que envió a Internet en un remolino - pudo  encontrar financiación para pagar a los mantenedores.</p>
<p>Otro ejemplo - GnuPG - Werner Koch casi se declaró en bancarrota tratando de apoyar a GPG - un proyecto que muchos otros dependen de la confianza en su proceso de lanzamiento. Fue rescatado, en la puerta de las muerte, por la iniciativa Infraestructura principal de la fundación linux.</p>
<p>Estos son ejemplos que terminaron con fondos; pero no todos los finales felices.</p>
<p>Tomemos el ejemplo de Capistrano. Herramienta de gestión de configuración muy popular alrededor de 2007-8, mantenido por Jamis Buck. En 2008, citando el agotamiento y el mantenimiento general, él renunció a apoyar a Windows, diciendo que &quot;Windows puede ser el gorila de 800 libras en la habitación, pero no es mi gorila, y no está en mi habitación&quot;. Este fue un movimiento increíblemente impopular; pero incluso con esa reducción, Jamis se quemó en 2009, abandonando Capistrano, y una serie de otros proyectos, sin mantenedores.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;Hi I&#39;m an engineer at a well-funded company and we need this feature can someone implement it for free?&quot; -- Every FOSS mailing list.</p>&mdash; Christophe (@Xof) <a href="https://twitter.com/Xof/status/622113231218192384">July 17, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>La cosa es - que esta es una comunidad que tiene un montón de dinero en efectivo. En el gran esquema de cosas, el desarrollo de software es una industria bien financiada. Si las empresas pueden encontrar dinero para mesas de futbolín y bolas de bolas meditativas, deben ser capaces de encontrar recursos para ayudar a mantener el software en el que han basado su éxito. Y si estás en el extremo receptor del problema - un desarrollador de software libre -  puede ser realmente frustrante.</p>
<p>Para mí, esta es la gran pregunta sin respuesta del movimiento del software libre: cómo reconciliar la discrepancia entre la clara demanda de un producto de software y la capacidad de convertir esa demanda en el tiempo y los recursos necesarios para atender esa demanda.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="software-libre-sueno-vs-realidad">
<h3>Software libre: Sueño vs Realidad</h3>
<p>Aunque la teoría dice que cualquier persona puede contribuir a un proyecto de software libre, en realidad, cada proyecto de cualquier significado tiene líderes. En el nivel más básico, es quien tiene el &quot;bit de commit&quot;. Y usted necesita ese liderazgo, especialmente cuando se trata de algo relacionado con el diseño. La mordaza corriente es que un camello es un caballo diseñado por comité. Las peores API que tratamos diariamente son las que fueron diseñadas por comité. Necesitas a alguien con gusto corriendo el espectáculo.</p>
<p>Pero hay un problema más grande - la extensión del compromiso que los usuarios tienen con un proyecto. Aquí hay un experimento para probar mi punto. Estamos en una habitación llena de usuarios de Python. Django es un proyecto de software libre.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>¿Quién en esta sala ha encontrado un error en Django, o tiene una pequeña cosa que les gustaría ver arreglada en la API de Django?</li>
<li>¿Quién ha convertido esa pequeña cosa  un informe de error de Django?</li>
<li>¿Quién ha enviado un parche a Django para esa arreglo?</li>
<li>De aquellos, quienes han tenido ese parche emergido?</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Cuando esto se hace delante de una audiencia en vivo, en cada pregunta, hay menos gente levantando sus manos</p>

<div class="section" id="productos-vs-proyectos">
<h3>Productos vs Proyectos</h3>
<p>Entonces, ¿qué está pasando aquí? Bueno, refleja 2 maneras diferentes de mirar un pedazo de software - proyectos y productos. Y es una cuestión de perspectiva personal - mi proyecto puede ser su producto, y viceversa.</p>
<p>Cuando veo algún código como un proyecto, es un cuerpo de código en el que estoy contribuyendo a un objetivo mayor. Estoy dispuesto a gastar recursos enfocados en las necesidades de otras personas con la esperanza de que sus necesidades ayudarán a mejorar el proyecto como un todo. Estoy dispuesto a hacer esto porque obtengo ganancias personales, como un perfil público mejorado; o si la herramienta está muy cerca de mi trabajo; o donde sé que puedo hacer una contribución sustantiva.</p>
<p>Pero cuanto más lejos me alejo de mi &quot;trabajo&quot;, y cuanto más difícil es hacer una contribución, menos inclinado estoy a <em>querer</em> contribuir al proyecto. La mayoría de las veces, es un producto que estoy usando, con las verrugas y todo. Si un producto tiene errores, trabajaré alrededor de ellos, o encontraré una alternativa, en vez de navegar por el proceso de contribución y contribuir con un parche.</p>
<p>En el caso de un producto, las libertades proporcionadas por el software libre son un poco como la libertad de expresión - es una libertad que definitivamente quiero, es reconfortante saber que está ahí, pero no paso todos los días asegurándome de explotar plenamente esas libertades. Hay personas que lo hacen - manifestantes, defensores de posiciones sociales controvertidas - y un día, dadas las circunstancias adecuadas, podría unirme y ayudarles. Pero la mayoría de las veces, sólo quiero ser pragmático, y seguir con la vida.</p>
<p>Esta dicotomía entre la teoría y la práctica es también la razón por la que comentarios como &quot;Parches bienvenidos&quot; se hacen en las listas de correo de software libre. Por un lado, es completamente correcto. Cualquiera <em>puede</em> contribuir, y en la mayoría de los proyectos los <em>parches</em> son bienvenidos. Pero la mayoría de la gente no mira un nuevo proyecto de código abierto como una oportunidad para participar y contribuir. La mayoría de la gente sólo quiere usar el maldito software.</p>
<p>Y se puede argumentar que es porque la gente se está centrando en la interpretación equivocada de &quot;libre&quot;, y no han &quot;capturado el espíritu del software libre&quot;. Lo cual es 100% cierto, pero totalmente contraproducente como una posición. Cualquier persona que ha hecho cualquier trabajo de diseño UX sabe que si los usuarios están cometiendo un error consistentemente, culpar al usuario no te lleva a ninguna parte. Usted estaba a cargo de lo que el usuario experimentó, y cometieron el &quot;error&quot; debido a una desconexión cognitiva fundamental.</p>
<p>E incluso si todo el mundo <em>obtuvo</em> el mensaje correcto - vamos a ser realistas - no funcionaría de todos modos. <a class="reference external" href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_M%C3%ADtico_Hombre-Mes">El mítico hombre-mes</a> nos mostró que no podemos entregar un proyecto más rápidamente o mejor, arrojando más personas en él. 9 mujeres no pueden hacer un bebé en 1 mes - un proyecto no sólo necesita recursos - que necesita los recursos <em>adecuados</em>, en las cantidades adecuadas. Y en última instancia, eso significa que los proyectos deben encontrar una manera de obtener los recursos que necesitan para ser autosostenibles.</p>
<p>Por lo tanto, eso significa que si queremos que el software libre se mantenga y mantenga bien, necesitamos encontrar una manera de financiar su mantenimiento.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="valor-de-uso-vs-valor-de-venta">
<h3>Valor de uso vs Valor de venta</h3>
<p>Hace 18 años, Eric S Raymond publicó un ensayo titulado &quot;La Catedral y el Bazar&quot;. Este ensayo catalizó el inicio del movimiento de código abierto - una redefinición del &quot;software libre&quot; para dejar claro que la apertura, no el precio, era la propiedad importante. Lo que no es tan bien recordado es que &quot;La Catedral y el Bazar&quot; no es el único ensayo escrito por Raymond en ese momento. Publicó otros 2 ensayos poco después - &quot;Homesteading the Noosphere&quot;, sobre la organización social y las motivaciones detrás de los proyectos de software libre, y &quot;The Magic Cauldron&quot;, sobre la <em>economía</em> del software libre.</p>
<p>Una de las distinciones clave que Raymond destaca en ese ensayo es la diferencia entre el valor de uso y el valor de venta.</p>
<p>El valor de venta de un producto es su valor como un producto vendible - literalmente, por lo que usted lo vende.</p>
<p>El valor de uso de un producto es su valor económico como herramienta, como multiplicador de productividad. Este es el beneficio económico que el usuario obtendrá del producto.</p>
<p>Lo importante es que los dos no están necesariamente conectados. En un entorno de fabricación tradicional, el foco está en el valor de venta, ya que por lo general está vinculado al costo de fabricación - el costo de las piezas y los materiales.</p>
<p>Pero la mayoría del software no se produce para el valor de la venta - es en casa el software producido para el valor de uso. En el caso del software libre, el valor de &quot;venta&quot; para el software libre es 0. Pero eso no significa que no hay valor de uso, y el problema es averiguar cómo explotar el valor de uso que existe dentro de una organización como un canal de monetización.</p>
<p>¿Entonces cuales son tus opciones?</p>
<p>Bueno, puedes vender mercancía. Y aunque esto es relativamente fácil de hacer, seamos honestos - no vas a financiar un imperio de software vendiendo camisetas.</p>
<p>Puede hacer que los usuarios paguen por la documentación. Escribe un libro, y haz que los usuarios lo paguen.</p>
<p>Desafortunadamente, el pequeño secreto sucio de la escena de la escritura de la tecnología es que nadie se vuelve rico escribiendo libros de tecnología. Son recursos increíblemente valiosos para la comunidad, son ideales para rellenar tu currículum, pero no son grandes como flujo de ingresos.</p>
<p>Un área que <em>si</em> paga bien es la de entrenamiento. Los empleadores están dispuestos a pagar mucho dinero por los cursos de capacitación; si usted puede juntar un taller intensivo de 3 días, usted puede venderlo una y otra vez.</p>
<p>Puede producir su oferta. El código fuente sigue siendo gratuito, pero un instalador simple y fácil de usar cuesta dinero. Esto funciona muy bien cuando cuando lo que tienes es un producto claramente identificable - como una interfaz gráfica de desarrollo - IDE.</p>
<p>Un modelo específico de generar un producto es Software como servicio - SaaS - dar el código de forma gratuita, pero pagar por la conveniencia de tener a alguien más para administrarlo por usted. Cualquier software de código abierto de la web es un buen ejemplo de esto - puede instalar el software en sus propios servidores, pero honestamente, a menos que tenga una razón, usted utiliza la solución alojada de alguien más y deja que ellos cuiden sus servidores por usted.</p>
<p>Pero, SaaS sólo es viable si se puede ofrecer <em>como un servicio</em> - lo que significa que es realmente sólo viable para la web. Y, como las tecnologías como docker comercializan el despliegue, es posible que incluso este flujo de ingresos se evapore.</p>
<p>Entonces, ¿qué más se puede vender?</p>
<p>Usted puede vender el acceso a los desarrolladores. Si eres el mantenedor de un proyecto, estás en la mejor posición para brindarle soporte o depurar problemas complejos, lo que significa que estás en una posición privilegiada para vender soporte y consultoría. <cite>Honza Král &lt;https://twitter.com/honzakral&gt;</cite> de ElasticSearch llama a esto el modelo de negocio &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; - &quot;¿A quién vas a llamar?&quot;</p>
<p>Puede vender el acceso al software. Trolltech hizo esto con Qt; Riverbank todavía hace con los enlaces de PyQt. La biblioteca en sí es GPL - pero si quieres usarla en un proyecto de código cerrado, puedes hacerlo, por un alto cargo. Esto tiene la ventaja de que obliga a los intereses comerciales a pagar por lo que están utilizando; pero también desincentiva el uso comercial a pequeña escala - si estoy escribiendo una nueva herramienta, y me veo obligado a elegir entre el código abierto de mi herramienta o un precio de $ 1000, probablemente elija un juego de herramientas diferente.</p>
<p>También puede entrar en el negocio de proporcionar certificaciones y garantías - código de auditoría para garantizar la calidad o compatibilidad, proporcionando garantías sobre el arreglo de errores, y certificar que las personas son expertos en el uso del producto. Esta es una parte importante de los modelos de negocio de RedHat, los paquetes de auditoría, asegurándose de que todos interactúan como se esperaba, asegurando que las actualizaciones de seguridad están disponibles y cumplen con los mismos estándares y certificando a los administradores del sistema.</p>
<p>Este es un conjunto de productos que atrae a la &quot;empresa&quot; de gama alta de la ciudad - y es un segmento lucrativo  del mercado. Pero esos clientes tienden a sólo necesitar estas garantías para ciertos tipos de software - en términos generales,  software &quot;aburrido&quot;. Su sistema operativo, sus base de datos - son piezas de software que necesitan ser sólidas en una empresa. Su barra de herramientas de depuración - no tanto, a menos que tal vez sean ofrecidas como parte de un conjunto/paquete de herramientas.</p>
<div class="section" id="socavar-tu-propuesta-de-valor">
<h4>Socavar tu propuesta de valor</h4>
<p>Otro problema con muchas de estas fuentes de ingresos es que si se ejecuta bien su proyecto, muchos de ellos se descartan - o por lo menos se ven severamente reducidas.</p>
<p>Si haces algo realmente fácil de usar, acabas de eliminar la necesidad de libros y cursos de formación, o, por lo menos, movido el terreno a cursos &quot;avanzados&quot;, que son más difíciles de escribir y tienen un público más pequeño.</p>
<p>Django vio esto de primera mano - la documentación de Django era reconocida por lo buena desde una  temprana etapa, y como resultado, era muy difícil conseguir que los editores aceptaran proyectos de libros de Django - porque la documentación era demasiado buena y estaba socavando el mercado para libros. Se ha tardado mucho tiempo, y sobre todo la auto-publicación, para obtener buenos libros Django disponibles para la venta.</p>
<p>Si usted tiene una lista de correo del proyecto, donde la comunidad responde a las preguntas de forma gratuita, y es una lista de correo saludable y sensible ... ¿por qué pagaría por el apoyo?</p>
<p>Si su software está bien diseñado, es modular, y esas interfaces están bien documentadas, y necesito una modificación - ¿por qué no acabo de escribir el modulo yo mismo?</p>
<p>Ahora, Ok - estoy exagerando. Hay razones legítimas para pagar por el apoyo o para traer un consultor incluso si las interfaces están limpias y bien documentadas. Pero mi punto es que cuanto mejor haces un trabajo como ingeniero de software libre, se hace más difícil hacer el caso de negocio para tu flujo de ingresos, porque la propuesta de valor se vuelve menos obvia.</p>
<p>Y si no está socavando directamente su propuesta de valor, todavía puede socavarle indirectamente, porque cuanto más tiempo gasta dinero, menos gasta haciendo lo que el dinero paga. Administrar un programa de certificación lleva tiempo. Escribir y ofrecer cursos de capacitación toma tiempo. La consultoría puede ser lucrativa, pero desarrollar un pipeline de ventas lleva tiempo. Y si usted está consultando, usted necesita cerciorarse de que el pipeline de las ventas esté lleno, que significa que usted va a errar en el lado de tomar más trabajo que menos ... que significa que usted acaba de cerrar la puerta en el el tiempo que tiene disponible para trabajar en código abierto.</p>
<p>También debe tener cuidado de que en la venta de su caso de negocio, no socave su proyecto principal. Si cada pregunta difícil en la lista de correo se responde con &quot;Podemos responder por una tarifa&quot;, va a sonar como un <em>shill</em>.</p>
<p>Si un proyecto dice que necesita dinero para asegurarse de que nos mantenemos al tanto de los problemas de seguridad ... usted tiene que ser muy cuidadoso cómo lo dice, porque la interpretación fácil es &quot;bueno, el proyecto debe ser inseguro, porque no están en la parte superior de la seguridad ahora &quot;.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="una-cuestion-de-escala">
<h3>Una cuestión de escala</h3>
<p>También hay una cuestión de escala. Python, Django - estos son grandes proyectos con grandes comunidades. Hacer un caso de negocio para Python o Django no es demasiado difícil. No trivial, pero posible. Pero ser el mantenedor de un proyecto más pequeño - como, digamos, Django Debug Toolbar - se espera seriamente que escriban y vendan un libro sobre Debug Toolbar? ¿O capacitación y certificación en su uso?</p>
<p>Los proyectos más pequeños no son menos importantes para la vitalidad del ecosistema general de Django, pero estos proyectos no tienen las mismas oportunidades para la recaudación de fondos que los proyectos más grandes.</p>
<p>También es importante darse cuenta de que no todos los productos tienen todas estas oportunidades de ingresos. Un IDE puede volverse un producto más fácil de mercadear; una librería de desarrollado probablemente no puede. Diferentes proyectos necesitarán diferentes mezclas de flujos de ingresos.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tienes-que-vender-algo">
<h3>¿Tienes que vender algo?</h3>
<p>Ok - pero podemos hacer esto sin vender nada en absoluto?</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;How to make money from open source&quot; is like &quot;How to make money from clean water&quot; or public education or science.</p>&mdash; Pieter Hintjens (@hintjens) <a href="https://twitter.com/hintjens/status/603446810183610368">May 27, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>El software libre se deriva de un imperativo moral - así que podemos financiar el desarrollo a través del altruismo y el patrocinio? Bueno, es más difícil, pero hay pruebas de que se puede hacer.</p>
<div class="section" id="crowdfunding-y-recompensas">
<h4>Crowdfunding y recompensas</h4>
<p>Una opción que ha visto mucha actividad recientemente es crowdfunding. Plataformas como Kickstarter e Indiegogo proporcionan un camino a un grupo de personas para lanzar y contribuir a un objetivo.</p>
<p>La comunidad de Django tiene un par de ejemplos de proyectos de crowdfunding muy exitosos, cada uno levantando decenas de miles de dólares (Django Migrations, Multiple Template engines, django.contrib.postgres, Django Rest Framework). Pero - si le preguntas a las personas que hicieron estos proyectos, no hicieron dinero en estos proyectos. La cantidad de tiempo de ingeniería que se invirtió en estos proyectos superó (con creces) el dinero recaudado.</p>
<p>Otra idea que se escucha regularmente es la idea de recompensas de la resolución de problemas (Bug Bounties) - la asignación de un precio para resolver un error específico. Esto es realmente sólo otra forma de crowdfunding - ¿Quieres arreglar un error específico o implementar una nueva característica? Contribuye con el dinero. Si tu <em>realmente</em> lo deseas - contribuye más. Y eventualmente alguien tomará el cebo y arreglará el error o implementará la característica.</p>
<p>Es un modelo atractivo - pero también tiene problemas - más notablemente, quién recibe el pago. ¿Pagas por líneas de código escrito? Esto ignora la contribución de los revisores del código. ¿Qué tan importante es escribir código comparado con revisar código o con encontrar un error?</p>
<p>Pero el mayor problema que veo con los enfoques de crowdfunding es que están en conflicto con el establecimiento de un ingreso laboral. Si te estás contratando a ti mismo, cuanto más corto sea el compromiso, mayor será tu tarifa por hora. Esta es una cobertura contra el desempleo al final del contrato. Si estás organizando un Kickstarter, es mejor tener un objetivo pequeño, claramente definido y claramente alcanzable. Así que lo puedes hacer en un mes o dos de trabajo.</p>
<p>Esto significa que necesitas para cobrar tu tasa de corto plazo con el fin de garantizar los ingresos a largo plazo. Pero también es de tu interés tener un objetivo de recaudación de fondos bajo, para que la campaña sea realmente exitosa. Si es demasiado alto, podría asustar a posibles patrocinadores. También significa que la comunidad paga una prima por cualquier característica nueva, que no es el mejor uso de los ya escasos recursos comunitarios.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="becas-patreon">
<h4>Becas, Patreon</h4>
<p>Ok - si deseas ingresos a largo plazo, es necesario mirar a compromisos a más largo plazo. Eso significa que deja de buscar fondos para proyectos específicos y empiezas a buscar financiación para la persona, con becas.</p>
<p>Estoy incluyendo a Patreon en esa lista porque es efectivamente &quot;crowdsourced patronage&quot;. No estás pagando por una cosa específica - estás pagando para que &quot;sigas haciendo lo que estás haciendo&quot;.</p>
<p>En los últimos 10 meses, Django ha estado utilizando este modelo. Contratamos a un desarrollador a finales del año pasado. El desarrollador - cuyo nombre es Tim Graham - es responsable de mantener las ruedas del proyecto engrasadas.</p>
<p>Desde un punto de vista técnico, este ha sido un éxito rotundo. Tim ha hecho un gran trabajo con el manejador de tiquetes (Issue Tracker), y los tiempos de respuesta en las revisiones de Pull Requests son más bajos.</p>
<p>La parte difícil ha sido recaudar el dinero para pagarle.</p>
<p>Hicimos una recaudación de fondos al principio del año específicamente para financiar al becario; esa campaña ha recaudado algo más de $ 50.000. Eso no es un cantidad pequeño de dinero - pero no es tampoco mucho cuando estás hablando de un empleado de tiempo completo. Vamos a necesitar hacer otra recaudación de fondos muy pronto si queremos que la beca continue.</p>
<p>Casi todos están de acuerdo en que ha sido dinero bien gastado, pero convertirlo en donaciones ha sido un trabajo duro.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="patrocinio-corporativo">
<h4>Patrocinio corporativo</h4>
<p>Otro otro enfoque para recaudar dinero es abrazar al diablo, e ir a los proveedores comerciales. Los intereses comerciales tienen dinero, así que ¿por qué no deberían pagar por ello? Esto puede ser muy exitoso bajo ciertas circunstancias - pero tienes que ser capaz de hacer un caso de negocio para el propietario corporativo.</p>
<p>OpenStack es un gran ejemplo de esto. ¿Por qué Rackspace, HP, Redhat, Ubuntu están interesados en OpenStack? Porque venden productos que se benefician de la mercantilización del entorno de alojamiento. Al hacer que sea barato y fácil de controlar las implementaciones en la nube, aumentan el tamaño del mercado para el alojamiento en la nube, lo que significa más dinero para su negocio principal - ya sea directamente (como Rackspace), o indirectamente (como RedHat, porque los servidores en la nube todavía necesitan sistemas operativos).</p>
<p>Node.js es financiado por Joyent por razones similares - Joyent está haciendo una apuesta a largo plazo, en la que si es más fácil desarrollar el software para la web, más gente escribirá dicho software , aumentando el mercado para los servicios de Joyent.</p>
<p>Sin embargo, Node.js es también un recordatorio sobre los problemas asociados a los intereses corporativos - ¿qué sucede cuando la comunidad y el patrocinador corporativo no están de acuerdo con la dirección del proyecto? Bueno, obtienes divisiones del proyecto, como la división io.js. El dinero corporativo puede corromper. Debemos tener cuidado de que la gobernanza del proyecto sea independiente de la fuente de financiamiento.</p>
<p>Tener un solo &quot;jefe&quot; corporativo también pone el proyecto en riesgo si ese &quot;jefe&quot; corporativo pierde interés. Django estaba originalmente bajo el ala de la World Company. Eventualmente, ese interés disminuyó, y el apoyo corporativo se acabó.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="venture-funding">
<h4>Venture funding</h4>
<p>La otra respuesta corporativa que se escucha es ir a buscar dinero/capital de riesgo/inversión. Y hay algunos ejemplos de gente haciendo esto. Meteor, por ejemplo, está financiando su desarrollo con dinero de un fondo de riesgo. Tienen mucho dinero para contratar a ingenieros, diseñadores - lo que necesiten.</p>
<p>¿Qué me pone nervioso sobre este modelo? Hemos estado aquí antes. ¿Quién recuerda aquí a Eazel? Para aquellos que no recuerdan, a finales de los 90, Eazel fue una empresa dot-com fundada para desarrollar el gestor de archivos Nautilus. Y, tenemos 2 años de código abierto. Y entonces estalló la burbuja, y la compañía se estropeó. Ahora, lo bueno es que todavía tenemos el código. Pero sería mejor tener el código en desarrollo activo.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="desarrollo-de-una-cultura-de-patrocinadores">
<h3>Desarrollo de una cultura de patrocinadores</h3>
<p>Y otra vez, toda esta discusión está sucediendo en una industria donde las valuaciones del mil millones de dólares están dando vueltas alrededor.</p>
<p>Grandes partes de nuestra industria, se basan en software libre - pero los que tienen más capacidad para contribuir, en muchos casos, no están contribuyendo.</p>
<p>Algunos lo están haciendo - hay algunas empresas que dan grandes cantidades de nuevo a las comunidades de código abierto. Pero también hay un montón de empresas que no retribuyen.</p>
<p>E incluso muchos aquellos que <em>si</em> retribuyen dan la ayuda que son capaces de dar, que no es necesariamente la ayuda que se necesita. La Django Software Foundation recibe regularmente ofertas de alojamiento gratuito o subvencionado de proveedores de alojamiento. Y no me malinterpreten - esto es genial, e increíblemente útil.</p>
<p>Pero lo que realmente necesitamos es alguien en la nómina para revisar los errores. Anteriormente en el ciclo de vida de Django, necesitábamos que la gente escribiera nuevas grandes características. Estamos en una constante necesidad de diseñadores gráficos, artistas, escritores de tecnología. Necesitamos personas que sepan cómo hacer administración de sistemas, y el alcance comunitario. Y no necesitamos 400 personas donando 1 hora; necesitamos 10 personas muy específicas donando 40 horas.</p>
<p>Cuando ocurre un desastre, organizaciones como la Cruz Roja piden donaciones. Y por lo general dicen &quot;por favor darnos dinero, no latas de comida o mantas&quot;. ¿La razón? El dinero puede comprar lo que se necesita. No puedes controlar lo que la gente dona, e incluso si la gente dona exactamente lo que se necesita, hay una enorme tarea logística de inventariar lo que se ha donado, y llevarlo donde se necesita.</p>
<p>Los proyectos de software libre son iguales - requieren recursos. Algunas empresas donan en especie, y eso es genial, pero rara vez es lo que se necesita, y es fácil distraerse averiguando qué hacer con todos los recursos que se han donado, pero no tienen un uso inmediato.</p>
<p>Y tristemente, al igual que con las organizaciones benéficas - muchas empresas no donan en absoluto. Y no estoy diciendo que estas compañías están siendo deliberadamente maliciosas en no financiar el código abierto - si algo, nosotros como comunidad les hemos fallado porque no les hemos ayudado a ayudarnos.</p>
<p>Lo más importante, no tenemos un mecanismo para que sea fácil gastar dinero, y sea fácil recibir dinero. El estado actual de las cosas demuestra claramente que no es suficiente que haya mucho dinero en una comunidad - hay que crear el mecanismo para que donar ese dinero sea tan obvio y sin fisuras como sea posible, y hay que tener a alguien para direccionar ese dinero donde se necesita.</p>
<p>Una comunidad modelo que creo que hace esto realmente bien es la comunidad de Wordpress. Wordpress es software GPL. Hay libros, videos, blogs sobre cómo escribir plugins y temas de Wordpress, lo mismo que para cualquier comunidad de software de código abierto. Pero  también hay libros, videos y blogs sobre cómo hacer un <em>negocio</em> escribiendo plugins y temas de Wordpress. Wordpress es GPL. Y por lo tanto, también lo son todos los complementos. Tienen una tienda donde puedes comprar complementos (y obtener los gratuitos), e instalarlos fácilmente en tu instancia de Wordpress.</p>
<p>El ecosistema de Wordpress ha aceptado fundamentalmente el hecho de que el dinero necesita ser parte de la ecuación, y al hacerlo han creado una industria que se autofinancia, y esto, diría yo, es una de las razones principales del éxito de Wordpress como una plataforma.</p>

<h3>Una propuesta polémica</h3>
<p>En ese sentido, me gustaría hacer una propuesta polémica.</p>
<p>¿Qué pasaría si <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi">PyPI</a> fuese una fuente de ingresos? ¿Qué sucedería si, al registrar una aplicación con <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi">PyPI</a>, pudieras especificar un precio: por instalación, o por versión, o por aplicación o por mes. Cuando hago &quot;pip install&quot;, el coste se agrega a mi cuenta PyPI, y recibo un cargo mensual en mi tarjeta de crédito; y que se pasa de nuevo a los proyectos de desarrollo.</p>
<p>Si hemos de creer en las estadísticas de PyPI, Django se descarga de PyPI más de 1 millón de veces al mes. Si hubiese un peaje de 10 centavos de dólar en cada descarga, eso recaudarían $ 100,000 por mes - suficiente para pagar 10 desarrolladores a tiempo completo bien pagos, o una cantidad considerable de diversidad, alcance, DjangoGirls y apoyo de la comunidad.</p>
<p>También podrías aprovechar la información de la dependencias de PyPi para pagar un porcentaje hacia estos proyectos. Si está escribiendo un proyecto que depende de otro, podría optar por pasar parte de sus ingresos hacia este proyecto. O bien, solicitar que los flujos proporcionen un &quot;peaje&quot;.</p>
<p>Y luego están las mayores dependencias de todos: PyPI y Python. Si PyPI tomara un pequeño recorte de los ingresos recaudados, eso podría ayudar a pagar por el desarrollo y mantenimiento de PyPI - y potencialmente Python también.</p>
<p>También puede tomar parte del dinero recaudado y ponerlo en un grupo de desarrollo, por lo que si hay un nuevo proyecto que necesita un poco de efectivo de arranque para empezar, o un proyecto establecido que necesita alguna ayuda para una gran tarea (como una actualización de Python 3 ), la comunidad en su conjunto puede fácilmente canalizar dinero hacia ese proyecto.</p>
<p>¿Qué pasa con las personas que no tienen dinero? Bueno, podemos ofrecer pases gratis. ¿Estás en un evento de DjangoGirls? Utilice este código promocional para obtener acceso gratuito.</p>
<p>Todavía puede regalar su software sin costo alguno. Y todavía es software libre - todavía estás entregando Python, así que todavía vas a obtener la fuente. Probablemente podrías incluso hacer que el proceso de inscripción sea completamente opcional. Todo lo que estaríamos haciendo es pavimentar el mecanismo - lo que facilita recaudar un peaje en la forma fácil en que utilizas un software.</p>
<p>No estoy diciendo que nada de esto sea fácil de implementar. Completamente aparte de cualquier reto técnico y solucionando los detalles, es un cambio filosófico grande para la comunidad, y ése es un asunto mucho más grande. Pero esta pregunta filosófica sobre el dinero es una discusión que nosotros, como comunidad necesitamos tener.</p>
<p>Lo que tenemos aquí es una <a class="reference external" href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedia_de_los_comunes">tragedia de los comunes</a>. Todo el mundo está de acuerdo en que este software es bueno. Todo el mundo sabe que el software debe mantenerse. Pero, ¿por qué una empresa individual debería asumir la carga económica de financiar el mantenimiento cuando sus competidores obtienen el beneficio de forma gratuita?</p>

<div class="section" id="aprende-de-la-mpaa-y-riaa-haz-que-sea-facil-hacer-lo-correcto">
<h3>Aprende de la MPAA y RIAA: Haz que sea fácil hacer lo correcto</h3>
<p>Para mí, la lección clave de la industria de la música y el cine de los últimos 20 años es que si usted hace más fácil hacer lo correcto, la gente hará lo correcto. Si tu puedes hacer simple y sin problemas para una gran empresa  deslizar tu tarjeta de crédito y que te cobren $ 100 al mes por usar todo este software de código abierto que se ha desarrollado, lo harán. Sí, la gente hará trampa. No te preocupes por ello, siempre y cuando la trampa no sea más fácil que hacer lo correcto.</p>
<p>La mayor razón por la cual esto no está sucediendo ahora es que no es obvio lo que es lo &quot;correcto&quot;. Podrías donar a la DSF o PSF ... pero es un poco complicado de organizar, y no está claro a dónde va el dinero ... Podrías inscribirte para soportar a algunos Patreons, o inscribirte para un programa de la recompensas ... pero no todo el mundo está allí, y los que están no ganan realmente lo suficiente para ganarse la vida, y no quiero sólo aportar dinero para cerveza.</p>
<p>Entonces, ¿qué vamos a hacer? La respuesta corta es &quot;No sé&quot;. Probablemente no existe una solución mágica. Me gustaría pensar que un canal de monetización en PyPI funcionaría, pero seré el primero en admitir que podría no ser la respuesta, o que puede haber problemas que no he previsto.</p>
<p>Pero creo firmemente que esta conversación sobre el dinero es una conversación que tenemos que tener. El software libre como movimiento tiene más de 30 años de antigüedad. El código abierto casi 20. Hemos superado los obstáculos técnicos. Incluso estamos conquistados los obstáculos políticos. Ahora es el momento de abordar la forma en que hacemos de esta una industria sostenible a largo plazo, no sólo los intereses comerciales que se aprovechan de la ingenuidad de una corriente de voluntarios de ojos azules.</p>
<p>En realidad voy a tomar otra posición ligeramente controversial, y <em>no</em> voy a tomar preguntas en este punto, por dos razones - en primer lugar, porque este tipo de charla son un imán para &quot;Tengo un comentario, no una pregunta&quot;; y también porque este no es un tema donde yo tenga las respuestas.</p>
<p>Esta es una discusión que necesitamos tener como comunidad - y estoy ansioso por tener esa discusión - no sólo en esta etapa.</p>
