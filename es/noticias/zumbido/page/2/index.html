  <p>9 months ago, we <a class="reference external" href="https://beeware.org/news/buzz/beeware-project-awarded-a-psf-education-grant/">announced that the BeeWare Project was the recipient of a PSF Education Grant</a>. In late 2019, we <a class="reference external" href="https://beeware.org/news/buzz/we-have-a-contractor-for-our-android-contract/">choose Asheesh Laroia to do the work</a>. Today, we're proud to announce that BeeWare's Android support has reached a point where it is ready for mass consumption.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://docs.beeware.org">The BeeWare tutorial</a> has been updated to include an Android track. The tutorial walks you through the process of writing your first app, and deploying it - first as a desktop app, and then on your phone. All you need is a Python install; everything else you need is downloaded automatically by the BeeWare tools as part of the development process.</p>
<p>And, to prove that it's real - we have uploaded Travel Tips to the <a class="reference external" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.keith_magee.traveltips">Google Play Store</a>. This is a Python app, in the Google Play Store, deployed from <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/freakboy3742/traveltips">the same source code</a> as the version in the <a class="reference external" href="https://apps.apple.com/au/app/travel-tips/id1336372310#?platform=iphone">iOS App Store</a>.</p>
<p>Huge thanks go to Asheesh for all the work he's put into this project. Delivering Android support in BeeWare has required considerable technical skill, attention to detail, and creative hacks; and Asheesh has consistently delivered. Huge thanks also go to the Education Grants Committee of the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/psf-landing/">Python Software Foundation</a> for the faith they placed in BeeWare when they funded this project. In 6 months (while simultaneously negotiating a world pandemic), we've gone from a nothing to a full Android implementation. Without their financial support, this project would still be a dream.</p>
<p>There's still plenty of work to be done, though. There are still a lot of widgets that need Android implementations, and new widgets that we want to add. We'd like to add support for device features like cameras, GPS and accelerometers. We'd like to make it easier to use binary Python packages like NumPy, Keras, and more. And we'd like to merge the work that we've done into CPython itself.</p>
<p>All of those are significant projects in themselves, and will require effort comparable to that required to add Android as a supported platform. And so, we're looking for the financial support to make that happen. We're applying for new grants as opportunities arise, but the most helpful source of funds are the ongoing funds that come from memberships. Ongoing funding means we can focus on improving BeeWare, rather than chasing grants. It means being able to hire <em>permanent</em> staff, rather than offering short term contracts. And it means being able to make long term plans and promises to the community.</p>
<p>If this project proves anything, it's that money makes things happen. If you're excited by the prospects of Python on mobile platforms, please consider <a class="reference external" href="https://beeware.org/contributing/membership/">joining the BeeWare Project as a financial member</a>. Or, if you've got experience with commercialisation of Open Source projects, or any other ideas for how we could  <a class="reference external" href="mailto:contact&#64;beeware.org">please get in touch</a>.</p>

  <p>For the last couple of months, we've had a contractor (<a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/asheeshlaroia">Asheesh Laroia</a>) <a class="reference external" href="https://beeware.org/news/buzz/we-have-a-contractor-for-our-android-contract/">working on fixing Android support in the BeeWare suite of tools</a>.</p>
<p>I've incredibly happy to announce that we've just hit our first major milestone: a working pure-Python application, running on an Android device!</p>
<iframe width="710" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g2B2wbgVq7s" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>This isn't the end of the project - it's just the beginning. There's still lots of fine tuning to be done (especially on the size of the support libraries), and we need to integrate this support into <a class="reference external" href="https://beeware.org/project/projects/tools/briefcase/">Briefcase</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://beeware.org/project/projects/libraries/toga/">Toga</a>.</p>
<p>However, in the meantime, if you're adventurous, you can take Asheesh's work-in-progress for a spin. His <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/paulproteus/Python-Android-support">Python Android Support repository</a> contains the current state of the work, and includes fairly comprehensive instructions for getting started. You'll need to know at least a little bit about native Android programming to make full use of this repository at the moment; but if you want to replicate the results from the video, that repository (and the other repositories it links to) should have everything you need.</p>
<p>Huge thanks go once again to the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/psf-landing/">Python Software Foundation</a>. Without their financial support, this work would still be on the drawing board. This project is just one of many ways that the PSF uses donations to improve the Python community and ecosystem. If your company uses Python in any capacity, I <em>strongly</em> encourage you to contribute financially to the PSF so that they can continue to fund worthwhile projects like this.</p>
<p>Huge thanks also go to Asheesh. Without his remarkable talents, attention to detail, and delight for obscure compiler errors, we wouldn't have made the incredibly fast progress that we've seen.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more announcements soon!</p>

  <p>A couple of months ago, we <a class="reference external" href="https://beeware.org/news/buzz/beeware-project-awarded-a-psf-education-grant/">announced</a> that the BeeWare project had received a grant from the PSF to improve our support for Android. At that time, we issued a call for contractors to help us complete this work.</p>
<p>We're very happy to announce that we've now selected a contractor: <strong>Asheesh Laroia</strong>.</p>
<p>Asheesh is a <a class="reference external" href="https://pyvideo.org/speaker/asheesh-laroia.html">regular speaker at Python events</a>, where he has delved into a range of detailed and complex topics. He also impressed us with the list of unconventional engineering integration projects he's been involved with in a professional and casual capacity.</p>
<p>When asked why he applied to work with BeeWare on this contract, Asheesh said: &quot;I use an Android phone every day, and I'm honored to be able to help implement the BeeWare vision of using Python to build first-class, native applications.&quot;</p>
<p>Asheesh will be starting work in mid December, and if all goes well, we should start seeing significant results by mid to late February. If you'd like to keep track of progress, you can <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/pybeeware">follow BeeWare on Twitter</a>; we'll also post larger updates on this blog.</p>

  <p>The BeeWare Project wants to make it possible for all Python developers to write native apps for desktop and mobile platforms. We have solid support for most desktop operating systems and iOS, but we know our Android support is lacking. The BeeWare core team knows what needs to be done to address the problem - what we’ve been missing are time and resources.</p>
<p>Thanks to the PSF Education Grants group, that’s no longer an issue. We’ve been awarded a US$50,000 grant to bring BeeWare’s Android support to a level comparable with our iOS support. We currently don’t have the time to do the work ourselves, so we’re calling for contractors to help us deliver this support.</p>
<p>This is a paid contract, which we anticipate lasting 3-6 months (depending on the experience of the winning contractor). You don’t have to be based in the US or Europe, either; the opportunity is open to anyone who can meet the requirements of the contract.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the task calls for some sophisticated skills, and we’re not in a position to provide extensive mentoring. A successful bid is likely to require some prior experience, and a history with the technologies involved.</p>
<p>A full <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18O2MDF49dHXDIKXyntfZUnXweXzR2i3jbHwWfHew-sE/edit?usp=sharing">role description</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IWhGs9C8V2TWcAsWhYvxmzi8slZ_vxncA5nn8LjR6ao/edit?usp=sharing">scope of work</a> for the contract is available. To register your interest, please forward your resume and cover email to <a class="reference external" href="mailto:contracts&#64;beeware.org">contracts&#64;beeware.org</a>.</p>
<p>We look forward to being able to announce full Android support in the near future!</p>

  <p>Google Summer of Code is coming to an end. I've spent the summer working on optimizing the
<a class="reference external" href="/project/projects/bridges/voc/">VOC compiler</a>, and I’m super excited to share the results.</p>
<div class="section" id="results">
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>There are a couple of ways to evaluate the performance improvement from my project.</p>
<div class="section" id="microbenchmarks">
<h3>Microbenchmarks</h3>
<p>Firstly, we introduced a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/voc/blob/master/tests/microbenchmarks.py">microbenchmarking suite</a>. Each microbenchmark is a small piece
of Python code that tests a single and specific Python construct, or datatype, or control flow.
The benchmarking infrastructure itself is crude (essentially it just tells you the total amount
of processor time it took to run, with no fancy statistics) but it has been extremely useful to
me while working on performance features to verify performance gain.</p>
<p>The idea is that the benchmarking suite is not to be run as part of the full test suite,
but rather as needed and manually whenever an optimization is implemented. It also provides a way to
check and prevent performance regression, especially on the &quot;optimized&quot; parts of VOC. While it
doesn't really make sense to record specific numbers, as they will always vary from machine to machine,
it should be reasonably easy to compare two versions of VOC. Benchmark numbers are included on each
optimization-related PR I've worked on this summer (see PR log below), and I hope that more benchmarks
will be added as more performance efforts are carried out in the future.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pystone">
<h3>Pystone</h3>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/voc/blob/master/tests/benchmarks/pystone.py">Pystone</a> is a Python <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhrystone">Dhrystone</a>, a standard benchmark for testing the performance of Python on a machine.
Here are the before and after results on my machine:</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Some things that I learned about VOC while working on this project:</p>
<p>1. Object creation in the JVM is expensive. This definitely does not mean that the VOC user
writing Python should think about minimizing the number of objects that she creates, but rather
that any time we can non-trivially reduce the number of objects created during bytecode
transpilation or in VOC-defined function calls, we can expect to see a huge performance boost.
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/voc/pull/825">Integer</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/voc/pull/830">boolean preallocation</a>, which is about reusing objects that have already been created,
was one of the most significant improvements we made this summer.</p>
<p>2. Method calls in VOC are expensive. This is essentially due to the process of invoking a callable:
you have to check that the method is defined on the object, then construct it (read: object creation!),
and check the arguments, before it can actually be called. (This is done using reflection, which is super
interesting and confusing in itself.) And this is the reason why <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/voc/pull/875">refactoring the Python comparison functions</a>
made such a big performance impact, because we were able to circumvent this process.</p>
<p>3. Exception-heavy code is expensive. Again, this is not to say that the programmer is on the hook for being
frugal when throwing exceptions, but that VOC benefits greatly by avoiding the use of exceptions internally
except when strictly necessary. For instance, Python uses StopIteration exceptions to signal the end of a for loop,
and they quickly rack up when you have nested loops (everything is ultimately related to object creation!). That was
the motivation for the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/voc/pull/881">nested loops optimization</a>.</p>
<p>If I may be a bit more reflective here, one of the a-ha! moments I had this summer was realizing that to really
optimize something, you have to understand where its biggest problems are first. I remember pitching to Russ at
the start of the summer things like loop unrolling, constant folding, even converting to SSA-form (you know, stuff I
heard about optimzation in my compilers class) and he was saying to me, think simpler. While working on my project,
I used a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jprofiler/overview.html">profiler</a> to understand exactly which parts of VOC were slow, and that information drove the changes we
implemented. I think it worked out pretty well!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="future-work">
<h2>Future Work</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Minimize boxing of primitive types like String and Int. As VOC is written half in Python, half in Java, a single integer can be found in various representations on its way through the compiler -- as a Python object, unboxed to a primitive Java int, then packaged back up to a Python object. This problem was (somewhat incoherently) addressed in my proposal, but ultimately we couldn't come up with a good abstraction to support it.</li>
<li>Build a peephole optimizer. <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Python/peephole.c">CPython's peephole optimizer</a> scans generated bytecode to identify sequences of bytecode that can be optimized, VOC could benefit from this too.</li>
<li>Hook up more benchmarks, which serve as both proof of the kinds of programs VOC can currently compile and areas ripe for performance improvement.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Thank you</h2>
<p>I will wrap this up by giving big thanks to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/freakboy3742">Russ</a>, my mentor. The time you spent helping
me form my ideas, patiently answering my questions and reviewing my work was invaluable
to me. It couldn't have been easy keeping up with what I was doing especially since I
started improvising halfway through the summer. I am so grateful for your help, thank you.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2018 has come to an end. During the three months long coding period, I have contributed several patches in VOC repository of BeeWare, all working towards the ultimate end goal of running <cite>asyncio</cite> module in VOC. In this blog post (which is my first actual blog post by the way 😄), I will document what I have done so far, why I couldn't make it to the end goal (yea, unfortunately I couldn't get <cite>asyncio</cite> to work at the end of GSoC 2018), and what's left that needs to be done in order to achieve the end goal (or at least make part of <cite>asyncio</cite> work).</p>
<div class="section" id="building-foundation">
<h2>Building Foundation</h2>
<p>The first error that the transpiler throws when attempting to compile <cite>asyncio</cite> module was &quot;No handler for <cite>YieldFrom</cite>&quot;, so it makes sense to start from this issue first.</p>
<p>Another feature related to generator was <cite>Yield</cite> expression. Before GSoC 2018, <cite>Yield</cite> statement in VOC was just a statement, meaning <cite>yield</cite> could not be used as expression. Generator methods such as <cite>generator.send</cite>, <cite>generator.throw</cite> and <cite>generator.close</cite> were not supported as well. Those features are what make asynchronous programming with generator possible, so I spent a few weeks to extend generator functionality in VOC, laying down the path to <cite>asyncio</cite> module.</p>
<p>PRs related to generator are listed below:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/voc/pull/821">PR #821</a> : Added support for Yield from statement (merged)</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/voc/pull/823">PR #823</a> : Added generator send method (merged)</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/voc/pull/831">PR #831</a> : Support exceptions handling in generator (merged)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="nonlocal-statement">
<h2>Nonlocal Statement</h2>
<p><cite>Nonlocal</cite> statement was another syntax not supported by VOC. After completion of generator's features, implementing this is the next step towards compiling <cite>asyncio</cite> module.</p>
<p>Implementing this feature took about 3 ~ 4 weeks as this is not as trivial as it seems. I took several approaches on this, while some of them do work, the code is not pretty and <cite>hacky</cite>, which could come back to bite me/other contributors in the long run. After many discussions with Russell, I refactored the closure mechanism in VOC and took a much cleaner approach in <cite>nonlocal</cite> implementations. I must admit that I took some short-cuts for the sake of &quot;making nonlocal works&quot; in the process of implementing <cite>nonlocal</cite> statement, resulting in poor design and messy codes. Many thanks to Russell, who helped me to improve my coding style and told me not to be discouraged when I'm stuck. 😄</p>

<div class="section" id="the-collections-module">
<h2>The Collections Module</h2>
<p>Next item on my hit list was pure Java implementations of the <cite>collections</cite> module. <cite>asyncio</cite> module depends on 3 data structures from <cite>collections</cite>, namely <cite>defauldict</cite>, <cite>Deque</cite> and <cite>OrderedDict</cite>. Two of them (<cite>defaultdict</cite> and <cite>Deque</cite>) are implemented in C in CPython, plus they have good analog in Java, so it makes senses to implement the module in Java. Porting <cite>defauldict</cite>, <cite>Deque</cite> and <cite>OrderedDict</cite> to Java in VOC is relatively straight-forward, taking about 1.5 weeks to complete.</p>

<h2>Towards The Ultimate End Goal</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, three months of GSoC coding period was not enough for me to bring <cite>asyncio</cite> module to VOC. The nonlocal statement implementation was the biggest blocker for me mainly because I didn't think thoroughly before writing code. If I were to plan carefully and lay out a general coding direction, I would've completed it in much shorter time and have time for other implementations. An advice for the aspiring and upcoming GSoC-er, don't rush your code, make sure you know 100% about what you're doing before diving into the codes.</p>
<p>With that said, following are the list of modules to be implemented/ported to Java before <cite>asyncio</cite> will work in VOC:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><cite>socket</cite> module (a bit tricky since Java doesn't support Unix domain socket natively)</li>
<li><cite>selectors</cite> module (high level I/O operations)</li>
<li><cite>threading</cite> module (might be easier to implement this first since threading in Python is an emulation of Java's Thread)</li>
<li><cite>time</cite> module (partially implemented in VOC)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Huge thanks to my mentor, Russell Keith-Magee for accepting my proposal, providing guidance and encouraging me when things didn't go as intended. It is truly an honor to be a part of the BeeWare community. I had a blast contributing to BeeWare project, and I'm sure I will stick around as a regular contributor.
Also shout out to the BeeWare community for answering my queries and reviewing my pull requests. 😄</p>

<p>Cuando diseñas una aplicación de interfaz gráfica, ya sea para escritorio, dispositivos móviles o navegador, una de las tareas más fundamentales es describir cómo colocar widgets en la pantalla. La mayoría de los kits de herramientas de widgets usarán un modelo de empaquetamiento de cuadrícula o caja de algún tipo para resolver este problema. Estos modelos tienden a ser relativamente fáciles al comienzo, pero se desmoronan rápidamente cuando tienes necesidades complejas de diseño o cuando tienes diseños que necesitan adaptarse a diferentes tamaños de pantalla.</p>
<p>En lugar de inventar un nuevo modelo de cuadrícula o de caja, el kit de herramientas del widget <a class="reference external" href="https://toga.readthedocs.io">Toga</a> widget toolkit adopta un enfoque diferente, utilizando un esquema conocido para diseñar contenido: <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">Cascading Style Sheets</a>, o CSS. Aunque CSS es más conocido por especificar el diseño en las páginas web, no hay nada intrínsecamente específico de la web al respecto. Al final del día, es un sistema para describir el diseño de una colección jerárquica de nodos de contenido. Sin embargo, hasta la fecha, cada implementación de CSS está vinculada a un navegador, por lo que la percepción es que CSS es un estándar específico del navegador.</p>
<p>Ahí es donde entra <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/colosseum">Colosseum</a>. Colosseum es una implementación independiente del navegador de un motor de renderizado CSS. Toma un árbol de &quot;nodos&quot; de contenido, como un DOM de un documento HTML y aplica instrucciones de diseño CSS para diseñar esos nodos como cuadros en la pantalla. En el caso de Toga, en lugar de diseñar los elementos <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;div&gt;</tt> y <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;span&gt;</tt>, diseñas objetos Box y Button. Esto le permite especificar diseños adaptativos increíblemente complejos para aplicaciones Toga.</p>
<p>Pero Colosseum como proyecto tiene muchos otros posibles usos. Se puede usar en cualquier lugar donde exista la necesidad de describir el diseño <em>fuera</em> del contexto de un navegador. Por ejemplo, Colosseum podría ser la piedra angular de un renderizador de HTML a PDF <em>que no requiere</em> el uso de un navegador. También podría usarse como una librería de pruebas e implementación de referencia para la especificación CSS en sí misma, proporcionando una forma ligera de codificar y probar los cambios propuestos a la especificación.</p>
<p>La implementación actual se basa en el proyecto de Facebook <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/facebook/yoga">yoga</a>: originalmente era un código portado de JavaScript a Python línea a línea. Sin embargo, yoga solo implementa la sección de Flexbox de la especificación CSS3.</p>
<p>Esta semana, comenzamos un gran proyecto: reescribir Colosseum para que sea un motor de CSS totalmente compatible. El trabajo hasta ahora se puede encontrar en la rama globo del repositorio Colosseum en Github. El primer objetivo es el cumplimiento de CSS2.1, con una implementación del modelo de caja de CSS tradicional y el diseño de flujo. Una vez que tengamos una implementación razonable de eso, buscaremos agregar diseños Grid y FlexBox desde el conjunto de especificaciones CSS3.</p>
<p>Esto es obviamente un trabajo grande. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/#css-levels">CSS es una gran especificación</a>, por lo que hay mucho trabajo por hacer, ¡pero eso también significa que hay muchos lugares para contribuir! Elije un párrafo de la especificación CSS, construye algunos casos de prueba que demuestren los casos descritos en ese párrafo y envía un parche que implemente ese comportamiento!</p>
<p>Esto resalta por que tu apoyo financiero es muy importante. Si bien <em>podríamos</em>  hacer esto completamente con un esfuerzo voluntario, vamos a progresar mucho más rápido si un pequeño grupo de personas pudiera enfocarse en este proyecto de tiempo completo. El apoyo financiero permitiría aumentar significativamente la velocidad de desarrollo de Colosseum y el resto de la suite BeeWare.</p>
<p>Si deseas que Colosseum y el resto de BeeWare se desarrollen hasta el punto en que puedan utilizarse para aplicaciones comerciales, considera apoyar a BeeWare financieramente. Y si tienes alguna idea para fuentes de financiación potenciales más grandes, por favor <a class="reference external" href="mailto:russell&#64;keith-magee.com">ponte en contacto</a>.</p>

  <p>Después de casi 4 meses de trabajo en <a class="reference external" href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/">Google Summer of Code</a> 2017, finalmente estoy completando mi propuesta.

<p>La mejor manera de demostrar que un producto es confiable para los clientes es usarlo. Por lo tanto, la forma de demostrar que <a class="reference external" href="/project/projects/libraries/toga/">Toga</a> es una herramienta eficaz para construir una interfaz gráfica de usuario es construir una aplicación completa que la utilice.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="/project/projects/tools/cricket/">Cricket</a> es una herramienta gráfica que le ayuda a ejecutar sus suites de prueba. Su versión actual se implementa utilizando <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/tkinter.html">Tkinter</a> como el marco de la interfaz gráfica principal. Entonces, ¿por qué no probar <a class="reference external" href="/project/projects/libraries/toga/">Toga</a> dentro de otro producto de <a class="reference external" href="/es/">BeeWare</a>? Eso es lo que he logrado durante mi trabajo de GSoC.</p>

Para ayudarme a mapear esto he estudiado más sobre <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/tkinter.html">Tkinter</a>, <a class="reference external" href="/project/projects/libraries/toga/">Toga</a>, <a class="reference external" href="/es/proyecto/proyectos/librerias/colosseum/">Colosseum</a>, <a class="reference external" href="/project/projects/bridges/rubicon/">rubicon-objc</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec">Objective-C</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/General/Conceptual/DevPedia-CocoaCore/Cocoa.html">Cocoa</a> y <a class="reference external" href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/">CSS</a>.</p>
<p>El trabajo que hice durante GSoC se envió a través del <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/cricket/pull/65">PR 65</a>, el informe en el <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/cricket/issues/58">Issue 58</a> y la demostración final se puede ver en este <a class="reference external" href="https://youtu.be/5kz_CmQYFYE">link</a>.

  <p>Con el programa Google Summer of Code 2017 llegando a su fin, es hora de resumir lo que hice durante el verano trabajando en Batavia.</p>
<p>Batavia es una parte de la colección de proyectos de BeeWare. Como todavía está en su primera etapa de desarrollo, por mi parte me ofreció implementar una serie de características que faltaban en Batavia, que van desde tipos de datos elementales, a través de la manipulación JSON y construcciones de lenguaje como generadores. Publiqué mi propuesta en <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/batavia/issues/483">este hilo de GitHub</a> y lo mantuve actualizado con mi progreso semanalmente.</p>
<p>Ten en cuenta que al final de GSoC, hemos decidido divergir de la propuesta inicial y renunciar a la aplicación de <cite>contextlib</cite> en favor de la compatibilidad con Python 3.6, que usa op-codes de 2 bytes.</p>
<p>En general, fue una gran experiencia de aprendizaje y diversión. Muchas gracias a mis mentores Russell Keith-Magee y Katie McLaughlin, y a toda la comunidad de BeeWare.</p>

  <p>Google Summer of Code 2017 está llegando a su fin. Después de tres meses de trabajo en el proyecto BeeWare, quisiera resumir mi trabajo y compartir mis experiencias.</p>
<div class="section" id="ningun-plan-de-batalla-sobrevive-al-primer-contacto">
<h2>&quot;Ningún plan de batalla sobrevive al primer contacto&quot;.</h2>
<p>Esta fue una de las primeras cosas que Russell me dijo después de que decidimos fundamentalmente reestructurar mi <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/118">calendario y metas de GSoC propuestos</a>. Durante el período inicial con la comunidad descubrimos que Toga era aún más difícil de probar como esperábamos. El estrecho acoplamiento entre el código independiente de la plataforma en  Toga-Core y las implementaciones dependientes de la plataforma para (Windows, MacOS, iOS, Linux, Android, Django, ...) nos estaba dando problemas para escribir pruebas significativas.</p>
<p>Esperamos que Toga se convierta en un proyecto de tamaño decente, por lo tanto queremos que tenga una base sólida y bien probada. Por esta razón, decidimos que pasaría la mayor parte de GSoC para reestructurar Toga para que ejecutar pruebas resultara más fácil de hacer. Además de eso, también añadiría pruebas de implementación para comprobar si un backend dado se implementa de la manera correcta. Si terminara antes del final del verano, empezaría con mi propuesta de proyecto original.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="la-gran-reestructuracion-de-toga">
<h2>La gran reestructuración de Toga</h2>
<p>Con los nuevos objetivos y una nueva rama comencé el viaje para reestructurar el proyecto Toga para hacerlo más fácil de probar.</p>
<p>Después de hackear y probar diferentes cosas en una <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Ocupe/restruc_toga">rama separada</a>. Identifiqué que las dependencias entrelazadas de la plataforma son el problema principal. Para separar el módulo Toga-Core de sus implementaciones de backend decidimos usar el patrón de fábrica en lugar del modelo de herencia que teníamos antes. Ahora cada backend tiene su propia fábrica que produce los widgets adecuados para la plataforma en la que se está ejecutando. De esta manera tenemos una clara separación entre Toga-Core y el nivel de implementación. Las dependencias de la plataforma ahora están incluidas en el nivel de implementación.</p>
<p>Después de que la nueva estructura fuera clara porté Toga-Core así como los backends para el Cocoa, iOS y GTK. Hice esto en la rama de Toga <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/185">(La gran reestructuración de Toga [WIP] # 185)</a>.</p>
<p>En la práctica, esto significaba que tenía que tocar manualmente casi todos los widgets de todos los backends para conectarlos al nuevo patrón de fábrica.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="desafios">
<h2>Desafíos</h2>
<p>Toga habla con los frameworks nativos GUI, por lo tanto tuve que tener un buen entendimiento acerca de los principios y conceptos detrás de cada uno de estos marcos. A veces me sentía abrumado por la complejidad combinada de todas las partes que componen Toga. La siguiente es la lista:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Cada backend de Toga se envuelve alrededor de un marco existente y único. Para envolver el marco que tiene que entender el marco.</li>
<li>&quot;Me encanta Python, ¿por qué tengo que entender Objetive C&quot;? Para trabajar eficazmente en los backends de iOS y macOS, tenía que aprender los conceptos básicos del Objetivo C, aunque sólo fuera para leer los documentos de Apple.</li>
<li>Toga tiene un montón de partes móviles. Hay backends, marcos, librerías para hablar con backends, librerías para realizar el diseño de la interfaz de usuario y más. Me tomó una buena cantidad de tiempo para entender todas estas partes. Lo siguiente es sólo una visión general de los conocimientos recién adquiridos durante GSoC:</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc">Rubicon-ObjC</a> para hablar con los backends de iOS y macOS.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="/project/projects/libraries/colosseum/">Colosseum</a> para entender y solucionar problemas de diseño.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/ast.html">Módulo AST</a> para realizar las pruebas de implementación.</li>
<li>El uso de patrones de diseño</li>
<li>Cómo estructurar grandes proyectos.</li>
<li>Leer y entender grandes y complejos pedazos de código.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="otro-trabajo-que-realice">
<h2>Otro trabajo que realicé</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>PR: Translated part of the beeware.org webpage into german. <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/beeware.github.io/pull/173">(PR #173)</a></li>
<li>Helped newcomers on Gitter and GitHub.</li>
<li>Tested if Toga would profit from static typing <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Ocupe/toga/tree/static_typing">(toga/static_typing)</a>.</li>
<li>Created an implementation test suite based on the AST module.</li>
<li>Added test for Toga-Core.</li>
<li>Updated and extended documentation on Toga-Core as well as the macOS and iOS Backend.</li>
<li>Created a toga-dummy backend.</li>
<li>First draft of the Settings API and working backend implementation for macOS.</li>
<li>Many small and big fixes on Toga-Core, cocoa, iOS, and GTK backends. All in the main PR <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/185">beeware/toga The Big Restructure of Toga [WIP]</a></li>

</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="futuro-trabajo-por-hacer">
<h2>Futuro trabajo por hacer</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Todo mi trabajo se encuentra en el PR <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/185">&quot;La gran reestructuración de Toga [WIP]&quot;</a>. Después de que los backends que faltan, a saber, Windows y Android, se incluyan, todo se puede emerger con la rama master. Tenemos que esperar a los backends que faltan, porque el nuevo esquema es incompatible con las versiones antiguas y no pueden coexistir.</li>
<li>La API de configuración de mi propuesta original no se ha terminado debido a las razones mencionadas anteriormente. Tengo un primer borrador de trabajo y seguiré trabajando en él después de GSoC en <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/222">este Pull Request</a>.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="shout-out">
<h2>&quot;Shout out&quot;</h2>
<p>Me gustaría dar las gracias a Russell Keith-Magee por ser un Mentor impresionante y por todo el tiempo que invirtió en mí durante GSoC. También quiero agradecer a la comunidad BeeWare por ayudarme cuando alguna vez tuve un problema. ¡Gracias!</p>
