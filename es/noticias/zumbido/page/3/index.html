  </p>
  
  <p>In October, we've (finally!) reached a major milestone - but there's still lots of work to be done!</p>
<div class="section" id="what-we-ve-done">
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>We finally finished the Toga audit!!</em>. We now have 100% test coverage of all Toga code on macOS, Windows, Linux/GTK, iOS and Android, with a consistent and fully documented API across all widgets. This has been a truly mammoth project, resolving countless bugs, adding dozens of new features, and improving platform support (especially on Windows and Android). Once we've finalised a couple of housekeeping issues, we will release Toga 0.4 incorporating all these changes. This will hopefully occur later this week.</li>
<li>We attended the <a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/2023-core-dev-sprint-in-brno-october-9-14/22868/21">Python Core Team Sprint</a> at the RedHat offices in Brno, Czechia. As a result of this attendance, we produced a draft of <a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-730-adding-ios-as-a-supported-platform/35854">PEP 730</a>, which is the first step towards formalizing support for iOS in CPython. An analogous Android PEP will be drafted once we've sorted out the process around the iOS PEP (as this is the first time a platform has gone through a formal process to be added to PEP 11's Tier 3 list).</li>
<li>We reworked the build system for Apple support packages to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/cpython-apple-source-deps">separate the compilation of dependencies</a> (like BZip2 and OpenSSL) from the compilation of Python itself. These libraries are updated infrequently, and on a completely different cadence to CPython itself, so treating them as re-usable resources rather than something that needs to be compiled at the same time as Python will significantly improve CPython build times.</li>
<li>We released <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/briefcase/0.3.16/">Briefcase 0.3.16</a>, formalizing our support for Python 3.12, and adding the new support for dynamic libraries on iOS. This release also formally downgrades our support for AppImage, following extended problems in supporting AppImage as an output format.</li>
<li>We released <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/rubicon-objc/0.4.7/">Rubicon ObjC 0.4.7</a>, formalising our support for Python 3.12.</li>
<li>We modified Briefcase to ensure that <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1475">macOS apps are universal by default</a>, with an <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1482">option to request a single-architecture build</a>.</li>
<li>We added a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1470">deep debug logging level</a> to Briefcase, and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1503">simplified the output of many other commands to ensure that important warnings aren't lost</a>.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2151">added support for Undo and Redo operations on macOS text widgets</a>.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1399">added support for user-registered fonts on iOS and macOS</a>.</li>
<li>We made some modifications to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2066">improve Toga's memory management when creating and destroying windows</a>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-s-next">
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>Now that we've <em>finally</em> finished the widget audit, we can finally release Toga 0.4, and start using the foundation that we've spent the last 12 months building.</p>
<p>In November, we'll start the work of upstreaming iOS patches to CPython core. The PEP we've drafted is nearing a form where it can be submitted to the Steering Council for approval, but the drafting process has raised a couple of technical issues that need to be investigated. However, while we wait for formal acceptance of the PEP, we will continue working on building continuous integration for our iOS CPython builds, and begin preparing patches that can be merged into CPython.</p>

  </p>
  
  <p>As 2023 rolls to a close, BeeWare is more stable than ever, and is progressing well. However, there's still lots of work to be done. As always, this roadmap should be read as a guide to what we aim to focus on over the coming quarter, rather than a hard commitment of features that will be made available on a specific deadline.</p>
<div class="section" id="q3-progress">
<h2>Q3 progress</h2>
<p>During Q3, Toga testing continued to be a major focus area. We've completed testing on macOS, GTK and Linux; and testing on Windows and Android is nearing completion. Along the way, we've resolved dozens of bugs, discovered (and resolved) dozens more, and we've been able to eliminate a bunch of inconsistencies in naming and usage between widgets. We've also substantially improved the API documentation for widgets.</p>
<p>As noted in our monthly status reports, progress has been slower than expected because of the large number of edge cases and platform inconsistencies that we've found along the way. We're still a couple of weeks away from completing this work; but once it's all completed, we'll be able to publish a new version of Toga.</p>
<p>This quarter, we've also resolved a major known limitation on iOS - binary module packaging. We are now able to confirm that BeeWare is able to produce apps with dynamically loaded binary modules that the iOS App Store will accept through their review process. In the process of resolving this limitation, we've started developing a Forge for mobile packages, significantly improving the tooling for building binary wheels for iOS.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="q4-priorities">
<h2>Q4 priorities</h2>
<p>Our Q4 goals are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Finalize Toga's test suite</strong>. For real this time - we'll have 100% branch coverage on every line of Toga's core, and on the macOS, Windows, GTK, Android and iOS backends. Once we've released a version of Toga that includes all these fixes, we'll be able to publish a plan for the road to 1.0.</li>
<li><strong>Python 3.12 support</strong>. We're expecting Python 3.12.0 to drop any day. We've already done some preliminary work on Python 3.12 support, but we'll need to finalise that work once the final release is available.</li>
<li><strong>Start upstreaming iOS and Android support to CPython</strong>. This quarter, we'll begin the process of upstreaming the patches for iOS and Android support that we've been maintaining to CPython core, and developing the CI infrastructure to run CPython's full test suite on iOS and Android. The eventual goal is for iOS and Android to be Tier 3 supported platforms in Python 3.13. This will take a while to finalise, but we've got around 8 months until the feature freeze for Python 3.13, so we're confident we can make this happen. We're attending the CPython Core Team sprint this month to kick start this effort.</li>
<li><strong>OptionContainer widget for iOS and Android</strong>. One of the big gaps identified during the Toga audit was the lack of content navigation widgets on iOS and Android. This quarter, we're going to start addressing this gap, adding an OptionContainer widget. This widget already exists for macOS, GTK and Windows, so we have an API design - we just need to find a way to make this API work on mobile platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Image Capture</strong>. We're finally going to start addressing device hardware capabilities. We're going to start with image capture - the ability to select an image from either the photo library, or take an image with the camera, and have that image available to Python code. As well as implementing this API, we're going to need to tackle permission handling in Briefcase so that apps can declare that they need access to the camera in a cross-platform way.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="longer-term-goals">
<h2>Longer term goals</h2>
<p>Over the last 18 months, a major focus has been ensuring that the tools we have are stable, tested, and fit for purpose. Looking forward, we'll be able to build on this foundation, adding more widgets (especially for app content navigation), and filling out notable gaps in widget platform support (such as Tree and Table widgets on mobile). We'll also start building out hardware support APIs (such as geolocation and accelerometers).</p>
<p>However, in addition to adding new features, we're going to start drawing attention to the features we already have. The Toga audit has enabled us to revise our API documentation, but API documentation is only a small part of the overall documentation story. Now that we have a stable base to work with, we're going to start improving our tutorials and HowTo documentation, lowering the barrier to entry for new developers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Toga and Briefcase are more stable than ever, and we've addressed all the major technical challenges that existed when full-time work on BeeWare started early last year. Now we can begin the work of building on the foundation that we've established, ensuring that everyone in the Python community can build native applications for their devices.</p>

  </p>
  
  <p>September has been a month of slow, but significant progress.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-we-ve-done">
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>We've resolved the issues around the iOS App Store rejecting BeeWare apps - and, by way of proof, we've updated our demo app, <a class="reference external" href="https://apps.apple.com/au/app/travel-tips/id1336372310#?platform=iphone">Travel Tips</a>. We've also updated the <a class="reference external" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.keith_magee.traveltips">Android version of the app</a>.</li>
<li>We've completely reworked the tooling for building binary packages for iOS. <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/mobile-forge">Mobile Forge</a> is our new project for maintaining iOS binary builds. It provides a much more robust environment for performing cross-compilation, making use of <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/benfogle/crossenv">crossenv</a>, rather than bespoke site package overrides. Getting crossenv working has also required us to do a deep audit of the various ways that Python reflects describes the platform it is running on, from the obvious ones like the <tt class="docutils literal">platform</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">sys</tt> modules, down to <tt class="docutils literal">sysconfig</tt> and the tags that are used by <tt class="docutils literal">pip</tt> to determine wheel compatibility.</li>
<li>We've completed an <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/Python-Apple-support">initial port of the iOS patches to Python 3.12.0rc3</a>. We're still hunting some edge cases, but initial signs are promising that we'll be in a position to do a near &quot;zero day&quot; release of Python 3.12 support for iOS.</li>
<li>For Android, we've re-enabled <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/chaquo/chaquopy/pull/937">Fortran support</a> in the package build system, and used it to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/chaquo/chaquopy/pull/949">upgrade SciPy</a>.</li>
<li>We were anticipating that would would complete the Toga Audit this month; however, that unfortunately hasn't happened. We've hit a bunch of complications with getting fonts and canvas support working on Windows and Android, and the process of getting those platforms working has revealed some inconsistencies in macOS, iOS and GTK font handling. However, we have completed the audit of <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2019">DetailedList</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1903">Font</a>, and the audit of <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2029">Canvas</a> is <em>almost</em> complete.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2112">decoupled the Winforms event loop from the main form in a Toga app</a>. This doesn't have any immediate impact on existing Toga apps - but it means we're now in a position to have windowless apps, such as system tray apps.</li>
<li>We completed the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1290">fixes needed to support Briefcase on Python 3.12</a>.</li>
<li>We made some <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1425">significant improvements to subprocess encoding handling</a>. This should significantly improve the user experience of Windows users, and users from non-English speaking countries.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1449">formally downgraded our support for AppImage to &quot;Best effort&quot;</a>. AppImage has proven increasingly difficult to work with as a format; now that we have native system packages and Flatpak as options, the effort needed to maintain AppImage support is better spent elsewhere. We'll still merge fixes to AppImage support if a PR is provided, but we're no longer actively fixing bugs, or running AppImage configurations in CI.</li>
<li>We added <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1468">filters to Xcode output to hide ignorable warnings</a>. Xcode builds have always been a little noisy; the new Xcode 15 release added even more noise. The filter means that these warnings will no longer distract from successful build output.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-s-next">
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, we didn't complete the Toga audit in September as we anticipated. As mentioned, we hit a number of complications and inconsistencies in font handling, especially in the Canvas widget, which slowed progress. We'll keep working on this audit in October; and once we're done, we'll make a release a new version of Toga. This release will include a number of backwards-incompatible changes identified as part of the audit, so be prepared for a bumpier-than-usual upgrade process.</p>
<p>Once the audit is complete, we'll also be looking at a technical limitation that the widget audit has revealed on Android. A number of Toga's Android widgets aren't as fully featured as they could be, due to the fact that accessing the full API would require subclassing a Java base class. This is an area where Chaquopy has some limitations; so we're going to try and address these limitations.</p>
<p>We'll also begin the work of upstreaming patches to CPython core. We've been invited to attend the CPython Core Team Sprint this month, which will be great opportunity to lay out the roadmap for formal iOS and Android support in CPython 3.13. This will also involve working on improving the CI infrastructure for building Android and iOS packages.</p>

  </p>
  
  <p>August has seen an important milestone reached in our Toga work, and some exciting new features.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-we-ve-done">
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>We attended <a class="reference external" href="http://2023.pycon.org.au">PyCon AU 2023</a>, and presented a new talk about the fundamentals of building GUI apps in Python; the video of this presentation is <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DH6rkImiZtc">already online</a>. At the sprints, 8 new contributors earned their challenge coins, for a range of small and large fixes.</li>
<li>The Toga Audit is complete on macOS, iOS and GTK! The last pieces were the audit of <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2058">Window</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2075">App</a>; with those PRs (and some others that are outstanding), we have 100% code coverage for Toga's codebase. Windows and Android are catching up rapidly - we've completed the audit of <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1996">OptionContainer</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2011">Table</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2017">Tree</a>, as well as a major revamp of <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2020">how layouts are calculated</a>, which ensures that minimum window sizes are enforced, and layouts on High DPI displays are correct.</li>
<li>We added a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2065">Texual backend for Toga</a>. This means the same Toga application will now run on 3 desktop platforms, 2 mobile platforms, as a single page web app, and in a terminal window. As with the web backend, there's still a lot of work to fill out all the widgets, but we've got enough in place to run the BeeWare tutorial app and the first 2 Toga tutorial steps.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1360">improved the architecture and word size checks that Briefcase performs when building apps</a>. This effectively adds support for 32-bit x86 and ARM platforms; we're limited in our ability to perform automatic tests to verify these platforms work as advertised, and upstream tooling isn't always up to the task (for example, Linuxdeploy doesn't support ARM at any word size) - but Briefcase now performs much more robust checks, and will make a best effort when support <em>should</em> exist.</li>
<li>We added <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1417">support for openSUSE (and other SUSE-derived distributions)</a> to Briefcase.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1397">updated the version of the Android command line tools that Briefcase uses</a>.</li>
<li>We resolved a long standing issue with the use of <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/pull/357">Objective C blocks on M1 hardware</a>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-s-next">
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>Based on current progress, it seems highly likely that the Toga audit will be complete on Windows and Android by the end of September. This will bring the Toga audit to completion, providing a very stable foundation for future work on Toga. It also means you can expect a new Toga release in the coming month, incorporating the myriad bug fixes and improvements that the audit has revealed. This release will include a number of backwards-incompatible changes identified as part of the audit, so be prepared for a bumpier-than-usual upgrade process.</p>
<p>So - what comes after the audit? Firstly, we'll be looking into iOS App Store submission - we've been made aware that although Briefcase apps work fine on both device and simulator, the App Store has been rejecting apps because of an internal layout issue. We have already begun work on this, and thanks to a contribution from the community, we have a very strong foundation for this work. We'll also start looking at Python 3.12 support, and making preparations for upstreaming our iOS patches into CPython core.</p>
<p>We'll also be looking at a technical limitation that the widget audit has revealed on Android. A number of Toga's Android widgets aren't as fully featured as they could be, due to the fact that accessing the full API would require subclassing a Java base class. This is an area where Chaquopy has some limitations; so we're going to try and address these limitations.</p>

  <p>The year rolls on, and so does progress on BeeWare!</p>
<div class="section" id="what-we-ve-done">
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>We attended <a class="reference external" href="http://europython.eu">EuroPython 2023</a>, presenting on Briefcase, attending the WASM summit, and running a very successful 2 day sprint.</li>
<li>We've completed the audit of all Toga widgets on macOS, iOS and GTK! We've also completed the audit of <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1969">ScrollContainer</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1984">SplitContainer</a> on Windows and Android.</li>
<li>We've added support for <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1331">Docker Desktop and rootless Docker on Linux</a>.</li>
<li>We've added the ability to get <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1389">detailed logs from the tools used by Briefcase to build apps</a>.</li>
<li>We've corrected some <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1375">warnings generated by pip when installing Python packages on Linux</a>.</li>
<li>We've added support for <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1377">generating APKs as an output format for Android</a>.</li>
<li>We've improved error reporting when <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1378">an application can't start on Android due to the device being too old</a>, or <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1356">the Android device clock isn't in sync with the developer's laptop</a>.</li>
<li>We added <tt class="docutils literal">__repr__</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">__str__</tt> implementations for Objective C structures like <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/pull/340">NSRect, NSRange, NSPoint and more</a>.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2027">formally dropped support for Python 3.7 in Toga</a>.</li>
<li>We improved error handling when <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2047">an app doesn't define a main window as part of it's startup</a>.</li>
<li>Type annotations in Toga <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2044">have been significantly improved</a>. We've been adding type annotations as part of the widget audit, but some types (such as callbacks) weren't as specific as they could have been. We're now using Protocols to define some of the more complex types in Toga.</li>
<li>We added an <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2050">ActivityIndicator</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2051">Divider</a> widget implementation in the Web backend.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-s-next">
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>The widget testing audit is now complete on macOS, iOS and GTK. An audit of App and Window functionality is all that stands in the way of 100% test coverage on those three platforms; it seems likely we'll get there by the end of this month. Android and Windows coverage is close behind, but might take a little longer.</p>
<p>Part of the reason for this delay is that we need to address an important change in the most recent release of Android Studio. Over the last few years, the Android ecosystem has been in the process of migrating its build system from Groovy to Kotlin; Android Studio Giraffe makes Kotlin the default for new projects, so we need to make sure we're compatible with that change. The widget audit has also highlighted that we need to improve our handling of subclass inheritance in Java; we're hoping to make some changes that will enable us to fill in a few more gaps in widget API coverage on Android.</p>
<p>We'll also be at <a class="reference external" href="https://2023.pycon.org.au">PyCon AU 2023</a> from August 18-22. We're presenting on Saturday; and we'll be there for the full duration of the sprints. See you in Tarntanya/Adelaide!</p>

  </p>
  
  <p>2023 is halfway done, and BeeWare continues to make steady progress. As always, this roadmap should be read as a guide to what we aim to focus on over the coming quarter, rather than a hard commitment of features that will be made available on a specific deadline.</p>
<div class="section" id="q2-progress">
<h2>Q2 progress</h2>
<p>As with Q1, our focus in Q2 was on Toga testing. This has been a mammoth project; but it's finally nearing completion. All but 2 widgets (Canvas and DetailedList) have 100% branch coverage on macOS, iOS and GTK, while Android and Windows are only 5 more widgets behind (ScrollContainer, SplitContainer, OptionContainer, Table and Tree). Along the way, we've identified and resolved lots of inconsistencies in widget APIs, and resolved countless bugs. We've also fully documented every widget, ported the test suite to Pytest, and added type annotations in the code (mostly for documentation purposes, rather than formal validation). We've also completed testing and coverage of a lot of the non-widget functionality that wasn’t strictly planned for this quarter - features like Images, Icons, Validators, application paths, and colors; plus a lot of tests (and bugfixes) in the core widget layout. We've also got the start of some tooling that can be used to test the Web backend.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we haven't been able to do any substantial Toga planning. Once Toga's code is at 100% testing coverage, we'll be in a much better place to develop those plans. We also haven't been able to add any native cross-platform hardware support.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="q3-priorities">
<h2>Q3 priorities</h2>
<p>Our Q3 goals are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Finalize Toga's test suite</strong>. By the end of Q3, we should have 100% branch coverage on every line of Toga's core, and on the macOS, Windows, GTK, Android and iOS backends.</li>
<li><strong>iOS Binary packaging</strong> We've been made aware that Apple is rejecting Briefcase packaged iOS apps from the iOS App Store because of a package layout issue associated with binary modules. This is a very high priority to fix.</li>
<li><strong>Kotlin upgrades</strong> The upcoming Android Studio release is switching to Kotlin as its preferred language for new Gradle configuration files; we need to upgrade Chaquopy's tooling to support this.</li>
<li><strong>Add full support for Java inheritance</strong> In the process of building Toga's test suite, it's become clear that a number of features can only be implemented by subclassing Java base classes. Chaquopy's ability to subclass is currently limited; to unlock all the features of Android, we need to resolve this limitation.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="longer-term-goals">
<h2>Longer term goals</h2>
<p>Our longer term goals are also <a class="reference external" href="../2022q4-roadmap">largely unchanged</a>. Toga 1.0 remains an important goal; once we're at 100% test coverage, we will be in much better place to provide estimates about Toga 1.0. Upstreaming is an area where we have some good news - as a result of discussions at Pycon US, we've received support for raising iOS and Android to the status of Tier 3 supported platforms in CPython, with the initial goal of having this in place for Python 3.13. You should expect to see movement on upstreaming towards the end of this year, and early next year. A forge for mobile packages is also remains an important goal; the completion of upstreaming work will make the goal of building a forge much more viable.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>At the end of Q2 2023, Toga's testing journey is nearing completion... but there's still lots of work to be done. However, the groundwork that we've been doing over the last 6 months has put us in a very strong position to develop Toga and the rest of the BeeWare ecosystem going forward.</p>

  <p>We're half way through the year! Work on the widget audit is almost complete; but that's not all we've been working on.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-we-ve-done">
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>We've completed the audit of <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1946">NumberInput</a>,  <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1949">WebView</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1951">DateInput, TimeInput</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1956">ImageView</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1955">Selection</a> on all platforms; and we've completed the audit of <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1969">ScrollContainer</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1984">SplitContainer</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1996">OptionContainer</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2011">Table</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2017">Tree</a> on macOS, iOS and GTK.</li>
<li>We've identified and resolved some <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1958">edge cases in the Pack layout algorithm</a>.</li>
<li>We've <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1964">improved the implementation of application paths, and audited the paths being returned on all platforms</a>.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2008">corrected some issues in the Web backend caused by the most recent PyScript and Pyodide releases</a>.</li>
<li>We've <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1992">improved the error message that is returned when a widget isn't implemented on a platform</a>.</li>
<li>We've updated Briefcase to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1271">use Java 17 when building Android projects</a>.</li>
<li>We've added support for the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1307">ANDROID_HOME environment variable</a> when building Android projects with a pre-existing copy of Android Studio.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-s-next">
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>The widget testing audit has been a mammoth project, but the end is very nearly in sight. There's only 2 widgets (Canvas and DetailedList) that haven't seen any testing to date; plus there's some non-widget features (like dialogs, fonts, windows, and basic App functionality) that still require testing. Once those tests are complete, we'll be moving on to dealing with some iOS and Android deployment issues that have been accumulating while we focused on Toga.</p>
<p>We'll also be at <a class="reference external" href="http://europython.eu">EuroPython 2023</a> from July 17-23. We're presenting on Thursday; and we'll be there for the full duration of the sprints. See you in Prague!</p>

  <p>May has been another month of steady progress - mostly on widget testing, but also in some other key areas of the project.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-we-ve-done">
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>We've completed the audit of the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1944">TextInput, PasswordInput,</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1938">MultilineTextInput</a> widgets; we've completed the audit of <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1946">NumberInput</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1949">WebView</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1951">DateInput, TimeInput</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1955">Selection</a> on macOS, iOS and GTK; and we've begun the audit of <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1956">ImageView</a>.</li>
<li>We've added documentation and tests for the input validation API as part of the TextInput audit.</li>
<li>We've added documentation and tests for ListSource as part of the Selection audit, and modified the implementation of Selection to use a ListSource.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1948">refactored the implementation of Dialog</a> so that it is architecturally consistent with the rest of Toga; this will hopefully also lead to an easier testing story.</li>
<li>We made <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1903">significant progress in supporting custom fonts on GTK</a>, including adding a GUI test of this capability.</li>
<li>We <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1093">completed a refactor of Briefcase's tool integrations</a>. This introduces a consistent API for all tools that Briefcase uses, as well as introducing type annotations for a lot more of the codebase.</li>
<li>We've introduced <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1262">conditional coverage to the Briefcase codebase</a>. This means developers who only have access to a single testing platform can get a 100% coverage report on their work before submitting to CI for cross-platform confirmation.</li>
<li>We've helped triage a number of bugs in the Python 3.12.0b1 release (revealed by our testing for <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1290">Briefcase</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/issues/313">Rubicon-ObjC</a>).</li>
<li>We've modified Briefcase's Flatpak backend to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1272">require an explicit runtime</a>, rather than falling back to a default runtime that is no longer supported.</li>
<li>We developed a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1285">draft implementation of a Briefcase test runner for the Web backend</a>. This is an important first step to being able to unit test Toga's Web backend; however, there's still a couple of technical challenges outstanding before we can complete that work.</li>
<li>We've begun the process of <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1271">upgrading Briefcase's Java support from Java 8 to Java 17</a>.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="what-s-next">
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>June will be another month with a focus on GUI test coverage. We're still hoping that this work will be complete by the end of June - we're averaging 1-2 widgets a week, and we have 8 widgets remaining; however, every widget is throwing up unique challenges (and revealing deep bugs - sometimes in the underlying GUI frameworks), so it's possible the audit work may need to continue into July.</p>

  <p>April was dominated by preparation and attendance at PyCon US 2023 - but we've seen some good progress over the month.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-we-ve-done">
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<p>PyCon US saw a lot of BeeWare activity:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>We presented 2 talks at PyCon US - one on <a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2023/schedule/presentation/20/">Briefcase</a>, and one on the <a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2023/schedule/presentation/145/">state of Android support on Python</a>. Videos of these talks should appear on the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/pyconus">PyCon US Youtube channel</a> in the near future.</li>
<li>We presented at the <a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2023/events/language-summit/">Language Summit</a>, where we received provisional approval to push for iOS and Android to become Tier 3 supported platforms in CPython 3.13.</li>
<li>We presented at the <a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2023/events/packaging-summit/">Packaging Summit</a>, providing the needs of packaging from a mobile perspective.</li>
<li>We had a booth in the community section of the conference show floor.</li>
<li>We ran a successful sprint where we handed out over a dozen Challenge Coins. Many of the improvements listed in this status update come from community contributions, and we have a backlog of other PRs we're still working on.</li>
<li>We donated an <a class="reference external" href="https://fosstodon.org/&#64;beeware/110245889923864511">leather Briefcase to the PyLadies Auction, raising US$800!</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In non-PyCon activity:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>We added the ability to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/890">code sign Windows release artefacts</a>.</li>
<li>We added a new distribution format for Windows apps - <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1183">simple ZIP archives</a>.</li>
<li>We modified Briefcase to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1219">support PEP621 metadata standards</a>. Briefcase predates the definition of PEP621, but there's a lot of overlap in what PEP621 defines and what Briefcase defines, so it makes sense for Briefcase to adhere to the common standard. In future, we expect to see more convergence with PEP621 standards.</li>
<li>We landed major updates to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1132">Briefcase's AppImage and Flatpak backends</a>. They now use Indygreg's <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone">Standalone Python</a>;  this significantly speeds up Flatpak builds, should be more stable on AppImage, allows us to switch to <a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/pypa/manylinux">manylinux</a> base images - and it reduces the number of projects that BeeWare is responsible for maintaining.</li>
<li>We got 2 more widgets to 100% GUI test coverage. One of these is the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1834">base widget</a>, so we're now able to guarantee basic functionality across all widgets.</li>
<li>We migrated Toga's web backend to use the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1838">Shoelace web components framework</a>. This is a much better match for Toga than Bootstrap was, as it is primarily focussed on rendering <em>widgets</em>, rather than HTML layout. We only have a handful of widgets ported over at this point - but the process of implementing widgets is relatively straightforward, so if you have web skills and are looking for a way to contribute, this would be a great place to get involved.</li>
<li>We added support for <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1894">cursor visibility</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1863">full screen mode</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1871">determining the current window</a> on Windows.</li>
<li>We added an API for <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1880">catching a 'confirm' action on TextInput widgets</a>.</li>
<li>We added support for <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1836">FreeBSD in Toga</a>.</li>
<li>We made a number of significant improvements to the Tox configurations to improve reliability, work around a bugs in the release of pip 23.1, speed up and parallelise test execution, enforce spelling and external linking in documentation, and to make easier to obtain coverage reports.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-s-next">
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>In May, we'll be continuing our push for GUI test coverage. Our current aim is to have complete widget coverage by the end of June.</p>

 4 April 2023
  </p>
  
  <p>It doesn't feel like it's been three months since our last roadmap update... but here we are, in April 2023. As always, this roadmap should be read as a guide to what we aim to focus on over the coming quarter, rather than a hard commitment of features that will be made available on a specific deadline.</p>
<div class="section" id="q1-progress">
<h2>Q1 progress</h2>
<p>Our focus this quarter has been on testing; however as with our last report, our progress has not been as significant as we hoped it would be. Getting the first tests in place has proved to be much more complex than we anticipated. In order to test widgets <em>at all</em>, we've had to set up all the infrastructure that will be necessary to test every other widget, such as defining the probes to inspect colors and fonts, and to ensure that the GUI framework has finished applying changes before performing a test assertion. The process of building the first tests has exposed a number of problems deeply embedded in the core of Toga - problems that either aren't observable or are easily masked when you're writing an application as a user, but can't be avoided when you're writing a test suite that will run fast and needs to have repeatable behavior. We're also testing the limits of the features exposed by each platform - and everything we do needs to be repeated on 5 GUI toolkits with 5 completely different views of the world.</p>
<p>The good news is that as of the end of Q1, we're finally getting traction on the problem. We're about a quarter of the way through the widgets by count. Admittedly, we've been tackling the simpler widgets first - but the lessons learned (and bugs fixed) making those simple widgets work should make testing the more complex widgets easier. There's also some commonality in the more complex widgets - for example, TextInput, PasswordInput and NumberInput are all essentially the same widget, so once tests are built for one of them, the other 2 should fall out reasonably easily.</p>
<p>We have also been able to release Toga v0.3.0. This release was almost 5 years in the making.</p>
<p>Q1 saw some unexpected improvements to Briefcase. We've had persistent problems supporting AppImage and Flatpak as packaging formats; during Q1, we couldn't avoid these problems any longer, so we introduced a System packaging backend, and made this the new default for Linux apps. We're now able to produce native system packages for Briefcase apps, supporting almost every Debian, Red Hat or Arch derived distribution. These packages are already proving more stable: we had no major issues during a recent tutorial at Everything Open 2023, despite a wide variety of Linux distributions in the room - something that we've never been able to say about AppImage.</p>
<p>However, once again, that means there's a lot left on the Q1 TODO list. Toga documentation is being slowly updated as we audit each widget; however, we haven't made any changes to the example apps; we haven't been able to do any substantial Toga planning; and we haven't been able to add any native cross-platform hardware support.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="q2-priorities">
<h2>Q2 priorities</h2>
<p>Our short term goals are, therefore, largely unchanged from last quarter:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Testing</strong> - Completing the Toga GUI testing suite will again be our primary focus for the quarter.</li>
<li><strong>Planning</strong> - Once we've got the test harness in place, we'll be in a much better position to evaluate what work remains to get to v1.0.</li>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong> - The process of systematically building a test suite also gives us an opportunity to update the API documentation for each widget as we go. There's still lots of documentation required on top of the API guide, but complete API documentation will be a big start.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-platform hardware</strong> - Cross-platform support for device hardware (especially mobile) is one of the banner features that makes mobile device support worthwhile. Providing proof that this hardware support is easy to use will be a key demonstrator for BeeWare as a platform.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="longer-term-goals">
<h2>Longer term goals</h2>
<p>Our longer term goals are also <a class="reference external" href="../2022q4-roadmap">largely unchanged</a>. Upstreaming, Toga 1.0, and a forge for mobile packages are all important goals for the BeeWare ecosystem. However, we don't expect to make any significant progress on most of these goals until we have solidified Toga's testing story. We should, however, see at least the first signs of progress on upstreaming BeeWare's work on mobile as a result of PyCon US, where we'll have a chance to raise issues directly with the Python core team.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Providing a robust GUI testing framework for Toga has definitely proven to be a lot more complicated than we originally thought. The good news is that as of the end of Q1 2023, we're finally starting to make good progress on testing. We hope that by the time of our next status update, we're able to report that we're nearing the end of our testing journey, and we can turn our focus to other areas of interest.</p>
