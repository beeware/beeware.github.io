  <p>BeeWare is now hiring!</p>
<p>The position is a full time, Mid- to Senior position. You will be
working full time in the Open Source group at Anaconda, on the BeeWare
suite of tools. Full details of the position <a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/anaconda/jobs/4211521">can be found on
Greenhouse</a>.</p>
<p>The position calls for an unusual combination of skills. The ideal
candidate would have experience building GUI applications (especially
mobile) <em>and</em> Python skills. However, because of the existing state of
the Python ecosystem, most Python developers don't have GUI development
experience, and most GUI developers don't have extensive Python
experience. For that reason, if the position is interesting to you, but
you don't have all the "must have" attributes - <em>I would encourage you
to apply anyway</em>. A candidate with no GUI development experience will
still considered, as long as they've got a demonstrated history of doing
weird and wonderful things with Python. Similarly, a developer with deep
GUI experience, but no Python experience, will also be considered.</p>
<p>The job location requirements are also unusual. The position is remote;
the position requires that your working hours need to be compatible with
UTC+8. This means candidates from Australia, South East and South Asia
will be a natural fit. European candidates will need to be prepared for
early morning starts. US/Canadian candidates will need to be prepared
for evening work (<em>very</em> late evenings if you're in CST or EST
timezones). Anaconda has the capacity to hire in the UK, Germany, India,
Australia, US, and Canada. If you're <em>not</em> a resident of one of those
countries, it <em>may</em> be possible to hire you, but it will likely require
you to operate as a private contractor rather than a salaried employee.</p>
<p>I'm incredibly excited for what the future holds for BeeWare - if you'd
like to come on this journey with me, <a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/anaconda/jobs/4211521">please
apply</a> (and tell
them Russell sent you)!</p>

  </p>
  
  <p>One of the benefits of <a href="/ar_AR/news/buzz/exciting-news-for-the-future-of-beeware">having the support of an organization like
Anaconda</a> is that we now
have the time to perform little housekeeping tasks like publishing
community updates. As a result, this is the first (of hopefully many)
monthly updates letting you know what progress has been made in the
BeeWare suite.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<p>During April:</p>
<ul>
<li>We've cleared the backlog of pull requests and issue triage. At this
point, the only PRs that are open are ones that require updates or
changes from the submitters. A lot of stale or duplicated issues have
also been closed or consolidated.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1448">Webviews on Windows now use the EdgeChromium renderer, rather than
the IE11 renderer</a>. This
massively improves the HTML compatibility of web views on Windows.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1461">Toga windows now use a "single source of truth"
approach</a>, using the API
calls of the underlying GUI platform to determine the title, position
and size of a window. This, in turn, allowed for the implementation of
APIs that allow you to set the title, position and size of windows on
desktop platforms.</li>
<li><code>on_exit</code> handlers on an App <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1463">can now be asynchronous
co-routines</a></li>
<li>Toga dialogs that return a result (such as YesNoDialog) now <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1464">use an
asynchronous API</a>. This is
a backwards incompatible change that was required to support dialogs
on Android; it also allows us to remove a nasty hack that was needed
on iOS. However, we've been able to implement this in such a way that
any existing usage that is incompatible with the new required usage
will be flagged with a helpful error.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1470">GTK web view has been
improved</a>, correcting some
odd caching behaviour.</li>
<li>Following the <a href="https://pyscript.net">announcement of PyScript at PyCon US
2022</a>, we've been able to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1475">resurrect the Web
backend for Toga</a>. This is
still in the very early stages - but it's sufficiently advanced that
we can run the first 2 tutorials, in both a "server side rendering"
and "single page app" format.</li>
<li>We've <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/690">improved Briefcase's code signing integration on
macOS</a>. This should
prevent some errors we've seen when signing apps that contain
third-party binary modules</li>
<li>We've significantly improved validation and error handling when an app
name contains <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/698">non-Latin
characters</a> ,
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/697">punctuation</a>, or
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/617">reserved words</a>.</li>
<li>We've added CI checks to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/700">ensure that Briefcase is always able to
generate a valid signed app
bundles</a></li>
<li>We've <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/704">improved the output generated by verbose debug
output</a> to improve full
environment details . This should make it easier to identify why a
command is failing due to unexpected user environments, and to assist
in manually reproducing Briefcase's behaviour outside Briefcase.</li>
<li>We now ensure that <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/714">macOS apps are *always*
signed</a>. This is needed
because <em>all</em> apps required at least ad-hoc signing to execute on M1
hardware.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of these PRs either began as, or are entirely the work of community
members. There are also dozens of smaller PRs, bug fixes, and bug
reports that are just as important, but are too numerous to list in a
post like this. A huge thanks to everyone who has contributed to BeeWare
during April.</p>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>In May, we'll be focussing on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updating the support packages for macOS and iOS apps. Apple's
transition to M1 hardware means there are new simulator architectures
that require support; this, in turn, requires that we adopt Xcode's
new XCFramework for the packaging libraries, which requires some
fairly major changes to the way the support packages are built.</li>
<li>Updating the support packages on Android to support Python 3.10.</li>
<li>Notarization on M1. This is becoming an increasingly required part of
macOS app publishing, as Apple cranks up the security requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>We're also expecting to start the hiring process in the coming month.
We'll provide more details when we can point a full job description. If
you think you'd like to make BeeWare your day job (or you know someone
who might), now would be a good time to start polishing your resume.</p>

  <p>The biggest challenge for any Open Source project is finding the
resources needed to support development - and the BeeWare project is no
exception.</p>
<p>To date, BeeWare has been primarily driven by the efforts of volunteers.
We've been able to achieve amazing things with those volunteer efforts,
demonstrating that Python is a viable language for GUI development on
macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS and Android, as well as providing a
proof-of-concept demonstration on Web. However, there are still lots of
features that we'd like to add, and lots of ongoing maintenance that
needs to be done as operating systems and hardware platforms evolve.</p>
<p>Over the years, we've been incredibly fortunate to have the financial
support of our members. While I'm incredibly grateful for that support,
it falls a long way short of even one full-time salary. We've also
received grants (such as the PSF grant), and short-term contracts. These
grants and contracts have enabled us to add specific (and much needed)
features to BeeWare - but they don't provide resources for ongoing
development and maintenance.</p>
<p>However, the brutal truth is that our rate of progress is severely
limited by the volunteered resources at our disposal. As a result, I've
spent a lot of time over the last few years thinking about how we can
fund the work that needs to be done to make BeeWare the go-to solution
for GUI development on desktop, mobile, and more - and do so without
compromising the Open Source roots of the project.</p>
<p>I'm incredibly excited to announce that I've found a solution.</p>
<p>On March 21, I joined Anaconda as a Principal Engineer and Team Lead -
and the team I will be leading will be focused 100% on BeeWare.</p>
<p>Anaconda is no stranger to Open Source. In addition to indirectly
funding a number of community efforts through their Anaconda Dividend
program, they directly employ people to work on Numba, Dask, Pyston and
more. BeeWare will be joining this stable of projects.</p>
<p>Anaconda is supporting BeeWare in this way because they see the
potential for Python as a language for GUI development - especially on
mobile platforms. Python has established itself as an incredibly popular
language in education, science, business and more - and in all those
markets, there is potential to develop apps. By adding mobile platform
support and app development to the list of tasks to which Python is
already incredibly capable, Anaconda hopes to ensure the long term
prospects of Python as a language, as well as ensuring a healthy market
for the products they sell commercially.</p>
<p>BeeWare will continue to be a 100% Open Source project, with all
contributions welcome from the community. The only difference is that
Anaconda will be directly employing some of the contributors to the
project. The conversations I've had with Anaconda's engineering
leadership indicates they are acutely aware of the tension that exists
between corporate funding and the technical direction of an Open Source
project. They've indicated that they want to ensure that BeeWare's
technical direction remains independent in both appearance and
substance. This includes financial independence - the financial support
provided by our members will remain vitally important, as it provides
project-level funding for resources such as hosting and promotional
materials.</p>
<p>The related good news is that part of my job title is "Team Lead" - so
in the very near future, we'll be looking for people to join me on my
team. I'm already working out the details of the team that I'd like to
have, so watch this space for hiring announcements.</p>
<p>Anaconda has a long history of understanding and contributing to both
the Python ecosystem and the Open Source community. Adding BeeWare to
their stable of supported projects has enormous potential for BeeWare,
and the Python ecosystem as a whole. I'm incredibly excited for what the
future holds.</p>

  </p>
  
  <p>Today, the BeeWare project is making 2 changes to the way we organize
our community.</p>
<p>Firstly, we're going to <strong>move our real-time chat community from Gitter
to Discord</strong>.</p>
<p>When we originally set up Gitter, it was a strong option for a chat
community - especially one that was focussed on a software project, due
to its tight integration with Github. However, over the years, Gitter
has undergone multiple changes of ownership, but has remained
essentially unchanged - in some cases, it's gotten appreciably worse
(their native iOS and Android clients are effectively deprecated). In
the meantime, Discord has emerged as a dominant player for community
chat. It has a robust mobile client, and really good tools for community
moderation, as well as the option of hosting video and voice chats -
something we hope to be able to use for coordinating virtual sprints.</p>
<p>To join the new BeeWare Discord server, <a href="/bee/chat/">visit this link</a>.</p>
<p>Secondly, we're going to <strong>start using Github Discussions</strong>.</p>
<p>For many years, we've tried to use Github Issues as a pseudo-forum.
There's a lot of similarity between how a forum works and how Github
displays and manages issues. Each "issue" is effectively a forum thread,
and each comment is a message in that thread. However, there are also
some important differences. Issues get closed when they're resolved;
forum threads, however, don't necessarily have a resolution. Most
importantly, "closing" an issue can look like someone is trying to kill
discussion - when all they're really trying to do is keep the list of
issues manageable.</p>
<p>The good news is that Github has noticed the similarity too, and has
launched Github Discussions. Discussions offers a familiar "forum"
interface, but with the familiar Github message interface, and tight
integration with Github Issues and pull requests.</p>
<p>We've enabled Discussions on all the key BeeWare projects -
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/discussions">Toga</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/discussions">Briefcase</a>, <a href="https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/discussions">Rubicon
ObjC</a>, <a href="https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-java/discussions">Rubicon
Java</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/colosseum/discussions">Colosseum</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/travertino/discussions">Travertino</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/podium/discussions">Podium</a>.</p>
<p>Naturally, all of these new community spaces - along with all existing
BeeWare spaces - are subject to the <a href="/community/behavior/">BeeWare Community Code of
Conduct</a>.</p>
<p>We hope these two changes will make it easier to participate in the
BeeWare community. See you there!</p>

  </p>
  
  <p>9 months ago, we <a href="https://beeware.org/news/buzz/beeware-project-awarded-a-psf-education-grant/">announced that the BeeWare Project was the recipient
of a PSF Education
Grant</a>.
In late 2019, we <a href="https://beeware.org/news/buzz/we-have-a-contractor-for-our-android-contract/">choose Asheesh Laroia to do the
work</a>.
Today, we're proud to announce that BeeWare's Android support has
reached a point where it is ready for mass consumption.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.beeware.org">The BeeWare tutorial</a> has been updated to
include an Android track. The tutorial walks you through the process of
writing your first app, and deploying it - first as a desktop app, and
then on your phone. All you need is a Python install; everything else
you need is downloaded automatically by the BeeWare tools as part of the
development process.</p>
<p>And, to prove that it's real - we have uploaded Travel Tips to the
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.keith_magee.traveltips">Google Play
Store</a>.
This is a Python app, in the Google Play Store, deployed from <a href="https://github.com/freakboy3742/traveltips">the same
source code</a> as the version
in the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/au/app/travel-tips/id1336372310#?platform=iphone">iOS App
Store</a>.</p>
<p>Huge thanks go to Asheesh for all the work he's put into this project.
Delivering Android support in BeeWare has required considerable
technical skill, attention to detail, and creative hacks; and Asheesh
has consistently delivered. Huge thanks also go to the Education Grants
Committee of the <a href="https://www.python.org/psf-landing/">Python Software
Foundation</a> for the faith they
placed in BeeWare when they funded this project. In 6 months (while
simultaneously negotiating a world pandemic), we've gone from a nothing
to a full Android implementation. Without their financial support, this
project would still be a dream.</p>
<p>There's still plenty of work to be done, though. There are still a lot
of widgets that need Android implementations, and new widgets that we
want to add. We'd like to add support for device features like cameras,
GPS and accelerometers. We'd like to make it easier to use binary Python
packages like NumPy, Keras, and more. And we'd like to merge the work
that we've done into CPython itself.</p>
<p>All of those are significant projects in themselves, and will require
effort comparable to that required to add Android as a supported
platform. And so, we're looking for the financial support to make that
happen. We're applying for new grants as opportunities arise, but the
most helpful source of funds are the ongoing funds that come from
memberships. Ongoing funding means we can focus on improving BeeWare,
rather than chasing grants. It means being able to hire <em>permanent</em>
staff, rather than offering short term contracts. And it means being
able to make long term plans and promises to the community.</p>
<p>If this project proves anything, it's that money makes things happen. If
you're excited by the prospects of Python on mobile platforms, please
consider <a href="https://beeware.org/membership/">joining the BeeWare Project as a financial
member</a>. Or, if you've got
experience with commercialisation of Open Source projects, or any other
ideas for how we could <a href="mailto:contact@beeware.org">please get in
touch</a>.</p>

  <p>For the last couple of months, we've had a contractor (<a href="https://twitter.com/asheeshlaroia">Asheesh
Laroia</a>) <a href="https://beeware.org/news/buzz/we-have-a-contractor-for-our-android-contract/">working on fixing Android

<p>However, in the meantime, if you're adventurous, you can take Asheesh's
work-in-progress for a spin. His <a href="https://github.com/paulproteus/Python-Android-support">Python Android Support
repository</a>
contains the current state of the work, and includes fairly
comprehensive instructions for getting started. You'll need to know at
least a little bit about native Android programming to make full use of
this repository at the moment; but if you want to replicate the results
from the video, that repository (and the other repositories it links to)
should have everything you need.</p>
<p>Huge thanks go once again to the <a href="https://www.python.org/psf-landing/">Python Software
Foundation</a>. Without their
financial support, this work would still be on the drawing board. This
project is just one of many ways that the PSF uses donations to improve
the Python community and ecosystem. If your company uses Python in any
capacity, I <em>strongly</em> encourage you to contribute financially to the
PSF so that they can continue to fund worthwhile projects like this.</p>
<p>Huge thanks also go to Asheesh. Without his remarkable talents,
attention to detail, and delight for obscure compiler errors, we
wouldn't have made the incredibly fast progress that we've seen.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more announcements soon!</p>

  <p>A couple of months ago, we
<a href="https://beeware.org/news/buzz/beeware-project-awarded-a-psf-education-grant/">announced</a>
that the BeeWare project had received a grant from the PSF to improve
our support for Android. At that time, we issued a call for contractors
to help us complete this work.</p>
<p>We're very happy to announce that we've now selected a contractor:
<strong>Asheesh Laroia</strong>.</p>
<p>Asheesh is a <a href="https://pyvideo.org/speaker/asheesh-laroia.html">regular speaker at Python
events</a>, where he has
delved into a range of detailed and complex topics. He also impressed us
with the list of unconventional engineering integration projects he's
been involved with in a professional and casual capacity.</p>
<p>When asked why he applied to work with BeeWare on this contract, Asheesh
said: "I use an Android phone every day, and I'm honored to be able to
help implement the BeeWare vision of using Python to build first-class,
native applications."</p>
<p>Asheesh will be starting work in mid December, and if all goes well, we
should start seeing significant results by mid to late February. If
you'd like to keep track of progress, you can <a href="https://twitter.com/pybeeware">follow BeeWare on
Twitter</a>; we'll also post larger updates
on this blog.</p>

  <p>The BeeWare Project wants to make it possible for all Python developers
to write native apps for desktop and mobile platforms. We have solid
support for most desktop operating systems and iOS, but we know our
Android support is lacking. The BeeWare core team knows what needs to be
done to address the problem - what we’ve been missing are time and
resources.</p>
<p>Thanks to the PSF Education Grants group, that’s no longer an issue.
We’ve been awarded a US$50,000 grant to bring BeeWare’s Android support
to a level comparable with our iOS support. We currently don’t have the
time to do the work ourselves, so we’re calling for contractors to help
us deliver this support.</p>
<p>This is a paid contract, which we anticipate lasting 3-6 months
(depending on the experience of the winning contractor). You don’t have
to be based in the US or Europe, either; the opportunity is open to
anyone who can meet the requirements of the contract.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the task calls for some sophisticated skills, and we’re
not in a position to provide extensive mentoring. A successful bid is
likely to require some prior experience, and a history with the
technologies involved.</p>

  </p>
  
  <p>Google Summer of Code is coming to an end. I've spent the summer working
on optimizing the <a href="/project/attic/voc/">VOC compiler</a>, and I’m super
excited to share the results.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>There are a couple of ways to evaluate the performance improvement from
my project.</p>
<h3>Microbenchmarks</h3>
<p>Firstly, we introduced a <a href="https://github.com/beeware/voc/blob/master/tests/microbenchmarks.py">microbenchmarking
suite</a>.
Each microbenchmark is a small piece of Python code that tests a single
and specific Python construct, or datatype, or control flow. The
benchmarking infrastructure itself is crude (essentially it just tells
you the total amount of processor time it took to run, with no fancy
statistics) but it has been extremely useful to me while working on
performance features to verify performance gain.</p>
<p>The idea is that the benchmarking suite is not to be run as part of the
full test suite, but rather as needed and manually whenever an
optimization is implemented. It also provides a way to check and prevent
performance regression, especially on the "optimized" parts of VOC.
While it doesn't really make sense to record specific numbers, as they
will always vary from machine to machine, it should be reasonably easy
to compare two versions of VOC. Benchmark numbers are included on each
optimization-related PR I've worked on this summer (see PR log below),
and I hope that more benchmarks will be added as more performance
efforts are carried out in the future.</p>
<h3>Pystone</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/beeware/voc/blob/master/tests/benchmarks/pystone.py">Pystone</a>
is a Python <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhrystone">Dhrystone</a>, a
standard benchmark for testing the performance of Python on a machine.
Here are the before and after results on my machine:</p>
<p>May 10th, 2018:</p>
<pre><code>$ python setup.py test -s tests.test\_pystone test\_pystone

</code></pre>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Some things that I learned about VOC while working on this project:</p>
<p>1. Object creation in the JVM is expensive. This definitely does not
mean that the VOC user writing Python should think about minimizing the
number of objects that she creates, but rather that any time we can
non-trivially reduce the number of objects created during bytecode
transpilation or in VOC-defined function calls, we can expect to see a
huge performance boost.
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/voc/pull/825">Integer</a> and <a href="https://github.com/beeware/voc/pull/830">boolean
preallocation</a>, which is about
reusing objects that have already been created, was one of the most
significant improvements we made this summer.</p>
<p>2. Method calls in VOC are expensive. This is essentially due to the
process of invoking a callable: you have to check that the method is
defined on the object, then construct it (read: object creation!), and
check the arguments, before it can actually be called. (This is done
using reflection, which is super interesting and confusing in itself.)
And this is the reason why <a href="https://github.com/beeware/voc/pull/875">refactoring the Python comparison
functions</a> made such a big
performance impact, because we were able to circumvent this process.</p>
<p>3. Exception-heavy code is expensive. Again, this is not to say that
the programmer is on the hook for being frugal when throwing exceptions,
but that VOC benefits greatly by avoiding the use of exceptions
internally except when strictly necessary. For instance, Python uses
StopIteration exceptions to signal the end of a for loop, and they
quickly rack up when you have nested loops (everything is ultimately
related to object creation!). That was the motivation for the <a href="https://github.com/beeware/voc/pull/881">nested
loops optimization</a>.</p>
<p>If I may be a bit more reflective here, one of the a-ha! moments I had
this summer was realizing that to really optimize something, you have to
understand where its biggest problems are first. I remember pitching to
Russ at the start of the summer things like loop unrolling, constant
folding, even converting to SSA-form (you know, stuff I heard about
optimization in my compilers class) and he was saying to me, think
simpler. While working on my project, I used a
<a href="https://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jprofiler/overview.html">profiler</a>
to understand exactly which parts of VOC were slow, and that information
drove the changes we implemented. I think it worked out pretty well!</p>
<h2>Future Work</h2>
<ul>
<li>Minimize boxing of primitive types like String and Int. As VOC is
written half in Python, half in Java, a single integer can be found in
various representations on its way through the compiler -- as a Python
object, unboxed to a primitive Java int, then packaged back up to a
Python object. This problem was (somewhat incoherently) addressed in
my proposal, but ultimately we couldn't come up with a good
abstraction to support it.</li>
<li>Build a peephole optimizer. <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Python/peephole.c">CPython's peephole
optimizer</a>
scans generated bytecode to identify sequences of bytecode that can be
optimized, VOC could benefit from this too.</li>
<li>Hook up more benchmarks, which serve as both proof of the kinds of
programs VOC can currently compile and areas ripe for performance
improvement.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thank you</h2>
<p>I will wrap this up by giving big thanks to
<a href="https://github.com/freakboy3742">Russ</a>, my mentor. The time you spent
helping me form my ideas, patiently answering my questions and reviewing
my work was invaluable to me. It couldn't have been easy keeping up with
what I was doing especially since I started improvising halfway through
the summer. I am so grateful for your help, thank you.</p>

  <p class="meta">

  </p>
  
  <p>In the blink of an eye, Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2018 has come to an
end. During the three months long coding period, I have contributed
several patches in VOC repository of BeeWare, all working towards the
ultimate end goal of running <span class="title-ref">asyncio</span>
module in VOC. In this blog post (which is my first actual blog post by
the way 😄), I will document what I have done so far, why I couldn't
make it to the end goal (yea, unfortunately I couldn't get
<span class="title-ref">asyncio</span> to work at the end of GSoC 2018),
and what's left that needs to be done in order to achieve the end goal
(or at least make part of <span class="title-ref">asyncio</span> work).</p>
<h2>Building Foundation</h2>
<p>The first error that the transpiler throws when attempting to compile
<span class="title-ref">asyncio</span> module was "No handler for
<span class="title-ref">YieldFrom</span>", so it makes sense to start
from this issue first.</p>
<p>Another feature related to generator was
<span class="title-ref">Yield</span> expression. Before GSoC 2018,
<span class="title-ref">Yield</span> statement in VOC was just a
statement, meaning <span class="title-ref">yield</span> could not be
used as expression. Generator methods such as
<span class="title-ref">generator.send</span>,
<span class="title-ref">generator.throw</span> and
<span class="title-ref">generator.close</span> were not supported as
well. Those features are what make asynchronous programming with
generator possible, so I spent a few weeks to extend generator
functionality in VOC, laying down the path to
<span class="title-ref">asyncio</span> module.</p>
<p>PRs related to generator are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/beeware/voc/pull/821">PR #821</a> : Added support
for Yield from statement (merged)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/beeware/voc/pull/823">PR #823</a> : Added generator
send method (merged)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/beeware/voc/pull/831">PR #831</a> : Support
exceptions handling in generator (merged)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Nonlocal Statement</h2>
<p><span class="title-ref">Nonlocal</span> statement was another syntax not
supported by VOC. After completion of generator's features, implementing
this is the next step towards compiling
<span class="title-ref">asyncio</span> module.</p>
<p>Implementing this feature took about 3 ~ 4 weeks as this is not as
trivial as it seems. I took several approaches on this, while some of
them do work, the code is not pretty and
<span class="title-ref">hacky</span>, which could come back to bite
me/other contributors in the long run. After many discussions with
Russell, I refactored the closure mechanism in VOC and took a much
cleaner approach in <span class="title-ref">nonlocal</span>
implementations. I must admit that I took some short-cuts for the sake
of "making nonlocal works" in the process of implementing
<span class="title-ref">nonlocal</span> statement, resulting in poor
design and messy codes. Many thanks to Russell, who helped me to improve
my coding style and told me not to be discouraged when I'm stuck. 😄</p>

statement support (merged)</li>

related test cases (merged)</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Collections Module</h2>
<p>Next item on my hit list was pure Java implementations of the
<span class="title-ref">collections</span> module.
<span class="title-ref">asyncio</span> module depends on 3 data
structures from <span class="title-ref">collections</span>, namely
<span class="title-ref">defauldict</span>,
<span class="title-ref">Deque</span> and
<span class="title-ref">OrderedDict</span>. Two of them
(<span class="title-ref">defaultdict</span> and
<span class="title-ref">Deque</span>) are implemented in C in CPython,
plus they have good analog in Java, so it makes senses to implement the
module in Java. Porting <span class="title-ref">defauldict</span>,
<span class="title-ref">Deque</span> and
<span class="title-ref">OrderedDict</span> to Java in VOC is relatively
straight-forward, taking about 1.5 weeks to complete.</p>

<h2>Towards The Ultimate End Goal</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, three months of GSoC coding period was not enough for me
to bring <span class="title-ref">asyncio</span> module to VOC. The
nonlocal statement implementation was the biggest blocker for me mainly
because I didn't think thoroughly before writing code. If I were to plan
carefully and lay out a general coding direction, I would've completed
it in much shorter time and have time for other implementations. An
advice for the aspiring and upcoming GSoC-er, don't rush your code, make
sure you know 100% about what you're doing before diving into the codes.</p>
<p>With that said, following are the list of modules to be
implemented/ported to Java before <span class="title-ref">asyncio</span>
will work in VOC:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="title-ref">socket</span> module (a bit tricky since Java
doesn't support Unix domain socket natively)</li>
<li><span class="title-ref">selectors</span> module (high level I/O
operations)</li>
<li><span class="title-ref">threading</span> module (might be easier to
implement this first since threading in Python is an emulation of
Java's Thread)</li>
<li><span class="title-ref">time</span> module (partially implemented in
VOC)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Huge thanks to my mentor, Russell Keith-Magee for accepting my proposal,
providing guidance and encouraging me when things didn't go as intended.
It is truly an honor to be a part of the BeeWare community. I had a
