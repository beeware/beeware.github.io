  <p class="meta">

  </p>
  
  <p>2023 is halfway done, and BeeWare continues to make steady progress. As
always, this roadmap should be read as a guide to what we aim to focus
on over the coming quarter, rather than a hard commitment of features
that will be made available on a specific deadline.</p>
<h2>Q2 progress</h2>
<p>As with Q1, our focus in Q2 was on Toga testing. This has been a mammoth
project; but it's finally nearing completion. All but 2 widgets (Canvas
and DetailedList) have 100% branch coverage on macOS, iOS and GTK, while
Android and Windows are only 5 more widgets behind (ScrollContainer,
SplitContainer, OptionContainer, Table and Tree). Along the way, we've
identified and resolved lots of inconsistencies in widget APIs, and
resolved countless bugs. We've also fully documented every widget,
ported the test suite to Pytest, and added type annotations in the code
(mostly for documentation purposes, rather than formal validation).
We've also completed testing and coverage of a lot of the non-widget
functionality that wasn’t strictly planned for this quarter - features
like Images, Icons, Validators, application paths, and colors; plus a
lot of tests (and bugfixes) in the core widget layout. We've also got
the start of some tooling that can be used to test the Web backend.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we haven't been able to do any substantial Toga planning.
Once Toga's code is at 100% testing coverage, we'll be in a much better
place to develop those plans. We also haven't been able to add any
native cross-platform hardware support.</p>
<h2>Q3 priorities</h2>
<p>Our Q3 goals are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Finalize Toga's test suite</strong>. By the end of Q3, we should have 100%
branch coverage on every line of Toga's core, and on the macOS,
Windows, GTK, Android and iOS backends.</li>
<li><strong>iOS Binary packaging</strong> We've been made aware that Apple is rejecting
Briefcase packaged iOS apps from the iOS App Store because of a
package layout issue associated with binary modules. This is a very
high priority to fix.</li>
<li><strong>Kotlin upgrades</strong> The upcoming Android Studio release is switching
to Kotlin as its preferred language for new Gradle configuration
files; we need to upgrade Chaquopy's tooling to support this.</li>
<li><strong>Add full support for Java inheritance</strong> In the process of building
Toga's test suite, it's become clear that a number of features can
only be implemented by subclassing Java base classes. Chaquopy's
ability to subclass is currently limited; to unlock all the features
of Android, we need to resolve this limitation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Longer term goals</h2>
<p>Our longer term goals are also <a href="/ar_AR/news/buzz/2022q4-roadmap">largely unchanged</a>.
Toga 1.0 remains an important goal; once we're at 100% test coverage, we
will be in much better place to provide estimates about Toga 1.0.
Upstreaming is an area where we have some good news - as a result of
discussions at Pycon US, we've received support for raising iOS and
Android to the status of Tier 3 supported platforms in CPython, with the
initial goal of having this in place for Python 3.13. You should expect
to see movement on upstreaming towards the end of this year, and early
next year. A forge for mobile packages is also remains an important
goal; the completion of upstreaming work will make the goal of building
a forge much more viable.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>At the end of Q2 2023, Toga's testing journey is nearing completion...
but there's still lots of work to be done. However, the groundwork that
we've been doing over the last 6 months has put us in a very strong
position to develop Toga and the rest of the BeeWare ecosystem going
forward.</p>



  

  
  
  

  
  <h2><a href="/ar_AR/news/buzz/june-2023-status-update/">June 2023 Status Update</a></h2>
  <p class="meta">

    في 30 June 2023 
  </p>
  
  <p>We're half way through the year! Work on the widget audit is almost
complete; but that's not all we've been working on.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul>
<li>We've completed the audit of
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1946">NumberInput</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1949">WebView</a>, <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1951">DateInput,
TimeInput</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1956">ImageView</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1955">Selection</a> on all
platforms; and we've completed the audit of
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1969">ScrollContainer</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1984">SplitContainer</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1996">OptionContainer</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2011">Table</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2017">Tree</a> on macOS, iOS and
GTK.</li>
<li>We've identified and resolved some <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1958">edge cases in the Pack layout
algorithm</a>.</li>
<li>We've <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1964">improved the implementation of application paths, and audited
the paths being returned on all
platforms</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2008">corrected some issues in the Web backend caused by the most recent
PyScript and Pyodide
releases</a>.</li>
<li>We've <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1992">improved the error message that is returned when a widget isn't
implemented on a platform</a>.</li>
<li>We've updated Briefcase to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1271">use Java 17 when building Android
projects</a>.</li>
<li>We've added support for the <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1307">ANDROID_HOME environment
variable</a> when
building Android projects with a pre-existing copy of Android Studio.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>The widget testing audit has been a mammoth project, but the end is very
nearly in sight. There's only 2 widgets (Canvas and DetailedList) that
haven't seen any testing to date; plus there's some non-widget features
(like dialogs, fonts, windows, and basic App functionality) that still
require testing. Once those tests are complete, we'll be moving on to
dealing with some iOS and Android deployment issues that have been
accumulating while we focused on Toga.</p>
<p>We'll also be at <a href="http://europython.eu">EuroPython 2023</a> from July
17-23. We're presenting on Thursday; and we'll be there for the full
duration of the sprints. See you in Prague!</p>
<h2>Want to get involved?</h2>

  </p>
  
  <p>May has been another month of steady progress - mostly on widget
testing, but also in some other key areas of the project.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul>
<li>We've completed the audit of the <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1944">TextInput,
PasswordInput,</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1938">MultilineTextInput</a>
widgets; we've completed the audit of
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1946">NumberInput</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1949">WebView</a>, <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1951">DateInput,
TimeInput</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1955">Selection</a> on macOS, iOS
and GTK; and we've begun the audit of
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1956">ImageView</a>.</li>
<li>We've added documentation and tests for the input validation API as
part of the TextInput audit.</li>
<li>We've added documentation and tests for ListSource as part of the
Selection audit, and modified the implementation of Selection to use a
ListSource.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1948">refactored the implementation of
Dialog</a> so that it is
architecturally consistent with the rest of Toga; this will hopefully
also lead to an easier testing story.</li>
<li>We made <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1903">significant progress in supporting custom fonts on
GTK</a>, including adding a
GUI test of this capability.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1093">completed a refactor of Briefcase's tool
integrations</a>. This
introduces a consistent API for all tools that Briefcase uses, as well
as introducing type annotations for a lot more of the codebase.</li>
<li>We've introduced <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1262">conditional coverage to the Briefcase
codebase</a>. This means
developers who only have access to a single testing platform can get a
100% coverage report on their work before submitting to CI for
cross-platform confirmation.</li>
<li>We've helped triage a number of bugs in the Python 3.12.0b1 release
(revealed by our testing for
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1290">Briefcase</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/issues/313">Rubicon-ObjC</a>).</li>
<li>We've modified Briefcase's Flatpak backend to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1272">require an explicit
runtime</a>, rather than
falling back to a default runtime that is no longer supported.</li>
<li>We developed a <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1285">draft implementation of a Briefcase test runner for
the Web backend</a>. This
is an important first step to being able to unit test Toga's Web
backend; however, there's still a couple of technical challenges
outstanding before we can complete that work.</li>
<li>We've begun the process of <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1271">upgrading Briefcase's Java support from
Java 8 to Java 17</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>June will be another month with a focus on GUI test coverage. We're
still hoping that this work will be complete by the end of June - we're
averaging 1-2 widgets a week, and we have 8 widgets remaining; however,
every widget is throwing up unique challenges (and revealing deep bugs -
sometimes in the underlying GUI frameworks), so it's possible the audit
work may need to continue into July.</p>

  <p class="meta">

    في 1 May 2023 
  </p>
  
  <p>April was dominated by preparation and attendance at PyCon US 2023 - but
we've seen some good progress over the month.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<p>PyCon US saw a lot of BeeWare activity:</p>
<ul>
<li>We presented 2 talks at PyCon US - one on
<a href="https://us.pycon.org/2023/schedule/presentation/20/">Briefcase</a>, and
one on the <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2023/schedule/presentation/145/">state of Android support on
Python</a>. Videos
of these talks should appear on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/pyconus">PyCon US Youtube
channel</a> in the near future.</li>
<li>We presented at the <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2023/events/language-summit/">Language
Summit</a>, where we
received provisional approval to push for iOS and Android to become
Tier 3 supported platforms in CPython 3.13.</li>
<li>We presented at the <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2023/events/packaging-summit/">Packaging
Summit</a>, providing
the needs of packaging from a mobile perspective.</li>
<li>We had a booth in the community section of the conference show floor.</li>
<li>We ran a successful sprint where we handed out over a dozen Challenge
Coins. Many of the improvements listed in this status update come from
community contributions, and we have a backlog of other PRs we're
still working on.</li>
<li>We donated an <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@beeware/110245889923864511">leather Briefcase to the PyLadies Auction, raising
US$800!</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In non-PyCon activity:</p>
<ul>
<li>We added the ability to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/890">code sign Windows release
artefacts</a>.</li>
<li>We added a new distribution format for Windows apps - <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1183">simple ZIP
archives</a>.</li>
<li>We modified Briefcase to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1219">support PEP621 metadata
standards</a>. Briefcase
predates the definition of PEP621, but there's a lot of overlap in
what PEP621 defines and what Briefcase defines, so it makes sense for
Briefcase to adhere to the common standard. In future, we expect to
see more convergence with PEP621 standards.</li>
<li>We landed major updates to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1132">Briefcase's AppImage and Flatpak
backends</a>. They now
use Indygreg's <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone">Standalone
Python</a>; this
significantly speeds up Flatpak builds, should be more stable on
AppImage, allows us to switch to
<a href="http://github.com/pypa/manylinux">manylinux</a> base images - and it
reduces the number of projects that BeeWare is responsible for
maintaining.</li>
<li>We got 2 more widgets to 100% GUI test coverage. One of these is the
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1834">base widget</a>, so we're now
able to guarantee basic functionality across all widgets.</li>
<li>We migrated Toga's web backend to use the <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1838">Shoelace web components
framework</a>. This is a much
better match for Toga than Bootstrap was, as it is primarily focussed
on rendering <em>widgets</em>, rather than HTML layout. We only have a
handful of widgets ported over at this point - but the process of
implementing widgets is relatively straightforward, so if you have web
skills and are looking for a way to contribute, this would be a great
place to get involved.</li>
<li>We added support for <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1894">cursor
visibility</a>, <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1863">full screen
mode</a> and <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1871">determining the
current window</a> on Windows.</li>
<li>We added an API for <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1880">catching a 'confirm' action on TextInput
widgets</a>.</li>
<li>We added support for <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1836">FreeBSD in
Toga</a>.</li>
<li>We made a number of significant improvements to the Tox configurations
to improve reliability, work around a bugs in the release of pip 23.1,
speed up and parallelise test execution, enforce spelling and external
linking in documentation, and to make easier to obtain coverage
reports.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>In May, we'll be continuing our push for GUI test coverage. Our current
aim is to have complete widget coverage by the end of June.</p>

    في 4 April 2023 
  </p>
  
  <p>It doesn't feel like it's been three months since our last roadmap
update... but here we are, in April 2023. As always, this roadmap should
be read as a guide to what we aim to focus on over the coming quarter,
rather than a hard commitment of features that will be made available on
a specific deadline.</p>
<h2>Q1 progress</h2>
<p>Our focus this quarter has been on testing; however as with our last
report, our progress has not been as significant as we hoped it would
be. Getting the first tests in place has proved to be much more complex
than we anticipated. In order to test widgets <em>at all</em>, we've had to set
up all the infrastructure that will be necessary to test every other
widget, such as defining the probes to inspect colors and fonts, and to
ensure that the GUI framework has finished applying changes before
performing a test assertion. The process of building the first tests has
exposed a number of problems deeply embedded in the core of Toga -
problems that either aren't observable or are easily masked when you're
writing an application as a user, but can't be avoided when you're
writing a test suite that will run fast and needs to have repeatable
behavior. We're also testing the limits of the features exposed by each
platform - and everything we do needs to be repeated on 5 GUI toolkits
with 5 completely different views of the world.</p>
<p>The good news is that as of the end of Q1, we're finally getting
traction on the problem. We're about a quarter of the way through the
widgets by count. Admittedly, we've been tackling the simpler widgets
first - but the lessons learned (and bugs fixed) making those simple
widgets work should make testing the more complex widgets easier.
There's also some commonality in the more complex widgets - for example,
TextInput, PasswordInput and NumberInput are all essentially the same
widget, so once tests are built for one of them, the other 2 should fall
out reasonably easily.</p>
<p>We have also been able to release Toga v0.3.0. This release was almost 5
years in the making.</p>
<p>Q1 saw some unexpected improvements to Briefcase. We've had persistent
problems supporting AppImage and Flatpak as packaging formats; during
Q1, we couldn't avoid these problems any longer, so we introduced a
System packaging backend, and made this the new default for Linux apps.
We're now able to produce native system packages for Briefcase apps,
supporting almost every Debian, Red Hat or Arch derived distribution.
These packages are already proving more stable: we had no major issues
during a recent tutorial at Everything Open 2023, despite a wide variety
of Linux distributions in the room - something that we've never been
able to say about AppImage.</p>
<p>However, once again, that means there's a lot left on the Q1 TODO list.
Toga documentation is being slowly updated as we audit each widget;
however, we haven't made any changes to the example apps; we haven't
been able to do any substantial Toga planning; and we haven't been able
to add any native cross-platform hardware support.</p>
<h2>Q2 priorities</h2>
<p>Our short term goals are, therefore, largely unchanged from last
quarter:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Testing</strong> - Completing the Toga GUI testing suite will again be our
primary focus for the quarter.</li>
<li><strong>Planning</strong> - Once we've got the test harness in place, we'll be in a
much better position to evaluate what work remains to get to v1.0.</li>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong> - The process of systematically building a test
suite also gives us an opportunity to update the API documentation for
each widget as we go. There's still lots of documentation required on
top of the API guide, but complete API documentation will be a big
start.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-platform hardware</strong> - Cross-platform support for device
hardware (especially mobile) is one of the banner features that makes
mobile device support worthwhile. Providing proof that this hardware
support is easy to use will be a key demonstrator for BeeWare as a
platform.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Longer term goals</h2>
<p>Our longer term goals are also <a href="/ar_AR/news/buzz/2022q4-roadmap">largely unchanged</a>.
Upstreaming, Toga 1.0, and a forge for mobile packages are all important
goals for the BeeWare ecosystem. However, we don't expect to make any
significant progress on most of these goals until we have solidified
Toga's testing story. We should, however, see at least the first signs
of progress on upstreaming BeeWare's work on mobile as a result of PyCon
US, where we'll have a chance to raise issues directly with the Python
core team.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Providing a robust GUI testing framework for Toga has definitely proven
to be a lot more complicated than we originally thought. The good news
is that as of the end of Q1 2023, we're finally starting to make good
progress on testing. We hope that by the time of our next status update,
we're able to report that we're nearing the end of our testing journey,
and we can turn our focus to other areas of interest.</p>

    في 3 April 2023 
  </p>
  
  <p>March has been a month of slow but steady progress for BeeWare.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul>
<li>Progress on GUI testing in Toga is continuing. We now have 7 widgets
fully tested, with another 2 in progress. As with last month's update,
getting these tests passing has required wrestling a lot of
fundamentals, in particular around the simulation of events such as
mouse clicks. We're also discovering (and fixing) lots of corner cases
in widget implementations that only surface when you're doing rigorous
and repeatable testing.</li>
<li>We've made some <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1794">major changes to the way GTK widgets are
rendered</a>. This change
significantly reduces the amount of re-rendering that is performed by
GTK, as well as resolving a number of long standing issues related to
resizing widgets.</li>
<li>Thanks to some community contributions, we were were able to add
support for <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1817">focus events and text
alignment</a> on GTK's
TextInput widget, and support for <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1821">text alignment and
fonts</a> on GTK's NumberInput
widget.</li>
<li>We landed the implementation of a <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1106">Linux system package
backend</a> for
Briefcase, which can output DEB and RPM packages. Thanks to a
community contribution, we were also able to add support for <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1143">Arch
packages</a></li>
<li>We modified the <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1107">locations where Briefcase outputs build
artefacts</a>. This
removes some sources of bugs associated with tools not supporting
spaces in filenames, and makes Briefcase's output consistent with
other tools in the Python ecosystem.</li>
<li>We made significant progress on <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1132">modifying Briefcase's AppImage and
Flatpak backends</a> to
use Indygreg's <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone">Standalone
Python</a>, rather
than BeeWare's Linux support package. Standalone Python is becoming a
de facto standard for pre-compiled Python builds (especially on
Linux), so it makes sense for BeeWare to converge on this common
standard. This change will also significantly speed up Flatpak builds,
should be more stable on AppImage, allows us to switch to
<a href="http://github.com/pypa/manylinux">manylinux</a> base images - and it
reduces the number of projects that BeeWare is responsible for
maintaining. We're currently waiting on a <a href="https://github.com/linuxdeploy/linuxdeploy-plugin-gtk/pull/45">fix to the linuxdeploy GTK
plugin</a>
to be merged before we can land this change.</li>
<li>Thanks to a community contribution, we added support for
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1125">PyGame</a> to Briefcase.</li>
<li>We migrated BeeWare's CI to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/.github/pull/14">use the new System packaging
backend</a> on Linux. This
means that CI is significantly faster, as building system packages
requires a lot less processing than an AppImage.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://pypi.org/project/travertino/">released Travertino 0.2.0</a>.
Travertino is the library that underpins Toga's Pack layout algorithm.
It's been several years since we last did a Travertino release, but
some recent bug fixes warranted an update.</li>
<li>We presented a tutorial at <a href="https://2023.everythingopen.au">Everything Open
2023</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also made a big change to our social media strategy: we started a
Mastodon account. We've wound down our Twitter usage at the end of last
year; going forward, you can get your bite size BeeWare updates from
<a href="https://fosstodon.org/@beeware">@beeware@fosstodon.org</a>.</p>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>In terms of technical goals, April will continue our push for GUI test
coverage. However, we're expecting progress to be a little slower,
because of one big event - <a href="https://pycon.us/2023">PyCon US</a>. We'll have
a booth in the community section of the conference floor; the core team
are presenting 2 talks; we're presenting at the Language Summit; and
we'll be at the sprints for the first 3 days. Preparing for these talks
will take up a lot of our time in April, as will the event itself - so
progress is likely to be a little slower than normal. If you're going to
be there, come by the booth and say hi! If you'd like to help us to
staff the booth - get in touch <a href="https://beeware.org/bee/chat/">on

  </p>
  
  <p>Although there haven't been a lot of new BeeWare features developed in
February, the work that has been completed represents some important
progress against our overall project goals.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul>
<li>The biggest milestone is that we have achieved 100% test coverage for
our first widget -
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1761">Button</a>! This may sound a
little underwhelming - after all, Toga has had a Button widget for a
long time, and has been fairly reliable. However, getting to this
point has required a lot of smaller (seemingly unrelated) problems to
be solved. It has also required setting up all the infrastructure that
will be necessary to test every other widget, such as defining the
probes to inspect colors and fonts, and to ensure that the GUI
framework has finished applying changes before performing a test
assertion). We've also taken this opportunity to start migrating the
Toga unit tests to <code>pytest</code>, which promises to significantly improve
our testing capabilities.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1778">formalised the relationship between Toga's Pack layout model and
CSS</a>. This should make it a
lot easier to determine what "correct" layout behavior should be.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1794">identified a low level issue with the way that layout is performed
on GTK, and possibly with other
platforms</a>. We're still
working through the consequences of this change, but it has indirectly
resolved a number of issues we have seen reported with widget layouts,
especially on GTK.</li>
<li>We've added the <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1078">ability to pass command line arguments to running
apps</a> from the
<code>briefcase dev</code> and <code>briefcase run</code> interface. This was primarily done
to make it easier to run unit test suites; but it can be used for any
other reason you might want to use a command line argument.</li>
<li>We have a <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1106">draft implementation of a Linux system packaging
backend</a> for
Briefcase. We've had consistent problems with both AppImage and
Flatpak, most of which can be traced back to resolving links to system
packages. We're not going to remove these backends - when AppImage and
Flatpak work, they're great options - but we're going to change the
default packaging backend on Linux to be system packages (i.e.,
DEB/RPM etc). This makes the simple case of building a package for
your own system much easier, while retaining the ability to build
packages for other distributions as required. We're hoping to land
this PR in the coming month.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1102">corrected an issue with threading
modes</a> that prevented
some Windows apps (especially PySide/Qt apps) from displaying dialogs.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1113">corrected an issue with the Briefcase Web
backend</a> that would
cause intermittent errors when loading a web app.</li>
<li>We updated our CI infrastructure to make better use of shared task
definitions. BeeWare has a lot of Github repositories, and a lot of
common tasks (such as rolling out an app across multiple Python and
operating system versions). Previously, each Github repository had an
independent set of CI task definitions; we've now got a central
collection of task definitions that is used by all repositories.</li>
<li>We cleaned up the <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1762">table in Toga's documentation describing the state
of support of each widget</a>.
This allows us to differentiate between widgets that we've fully
tested, and widgets that exist, but haven't been tested.</li>
<li>Thanks to a community contribution, we've been able to <a href="https://github.com/freakboy3742/chaquopy/pull/4">publish a
backlog of iOS binary packages for Python
3.8-3.11</a>. For the
packages we currently support (including Numpy, Pandas, Pillow and
more), we're now able to offer an iOS binary wheel for every published
version for which there is a corresponding macOS wheel, going back to
2019.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>In March, we'll be continuing to improve GUI test coverage. Now that
we've got one widget to 100% coverage, we know we have all the core
testing infrastructure in place, so it should be much easier to
implement tests for the future widgets. By the end of March, we should
have a lot more widgets at 100% coverage.</p>
<p>We'll also be presenting at <a href="https://2023.everythingopen.au">Everything Open
2023</a>. If you're attending, come say hi!</p>

    في 1 February 2023 
  </p>
  
  <p>BeeWare has had an exciting start to the new year, with a couple of
significant releases</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<p>We had two big releases in January.</p>
<p>Firstly, we released Briefcase 0.3.12. This is the first Briefcase
release in 3 months, so it includes a lot of improvements, but the most
notable improvements are the new "Testing mode", a major improvement to
the Android build process, and a huge number of bug fixes and
improvements - especially on Windows.</p>
<p>Secondly - and more importantly - we released Toga 0.3.0! No more dev
releases or <code>--pre</code> flags for <code>pip</code> - the stable release of Toga on PyPI
is now closely tracking actual development. It's been over 5 years since
we last released an official stable Toga version, even though we've been
recommending the dev releases for most of that time. However, as a
result of a number of changes that landed this month, we're finally
committing to the 0.3.0 branch properly.</p>
<p>These releases incorporate changes going back months (and years); but we
made some very specific progress during January:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chaquopy <a href="https://chaquo.com/chaquopy/chaquopy-version-14-0-2/">had a new
release.</a>,
significantly improving build times on Android, improving the
rendering of <code>stdout</code> content in the Android logs, adding some
features that make it easier to expose the original project source
code in the running app bundle, and enabling PEP517 builds of project
dependencies.</li>
<li>Briefcase is now able to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1058">reference local source packages when
building Linux AppImage
binaries</a>.</li>
<li>Some errors caused by the way the Windows Store version of Python
handles local application data <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1054">have been
corrected</a>.</li>
<li>Briefcase's help text now <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1005">shows the list of platforms and output
formats</a>, rather than
requiring an additional help call to retrieve that information.</li>
<li>Some issues with thread and asyncio safety in Rubicon ObjC were
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/pull/246">identified and
resolved</a>, along
with an issue associated with the way some Objective C classes (such
as NSWindow) are <a href="https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/pull/258">renamed at
runtime</a>.</li>
<li>Initial GUI testing backends for
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1707">macOS</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1749">iOS</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1755">GTK</a> were added.</li>
<li>A long standing issue with the <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/1439">replacement of root window
content</a> on GTK and iOS
has been resolved.</li>
<li>Coverage testing was <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1747">added to the Toga Android GUI test
backend</a>.</li>
<li>An API was added to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1728">allow scrolling MultilineTextInput
widgets</a> to the top and
bottom of the widget content.</li>
<li>The work <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1675">moving Toga to use
Setuptools-SCM</a> was
completed. Development versions of Toga will now report a specific
version control commit; release versions have their version determined
by the git tag used to produce the release.</li>
<li>We completed a major review of the way we're using Github issue
labels, and modified those labels to be consistent across all

</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>Much of the last 3 months have been spent getting a GUI testing
framework in place for Toga. That work is now in place, so now we'll be
working full time on writing GUI tests for Toga, with the aim of getting
Toga to 100% coverage. Along the way, we'll discover all the edge cases,
bugs, and partially missing implementations that are lurking in the
individual Toga widgets.</p>
<h2>Want to get involved?</h2>
<p>Want to get involved? Here are some open issues that would be a great

    في 11 January 2023 
  </p>
  
  <p>Welcome to a new year! 2022 saw some amazing progress for BeeWare; and
we've got some big plans for 2023. As always, this roadmap should be
read as a guide to what we aim to focus on over the coming quarter,
rather than a hard commitment of features that will be made available on
a specific deadline.</p>
<h2>Q4 progress</h2>
<p>Progress in Q4 was not as significant as we originally planned. A
combination of conference travel and holiday leave meant the quarter was
shorter than most; but even then, our goals for the quarter were
extremely optimistic.</p>
<p>We were able to hit our goal for <strong>Web deployment</strong>. We've restored the
Toga web backend to a working state, and we've added a Web deployment
backend to Briefcase. There's still a lot of work required before Web
deployment is a viable as a production solution, but the initial pieces
are now in place.</p>
<p>We were also able to hit our goals on <strong>housekeeping</strong>. We've made a lot
of improvements to the base infrastructure of repositories, enabling
Black, pre-commit, and towncrier in Toga, and improving coverage
reporting (including getting to 100% branch coverage in Briefcase's test
suite).</p>
<p>We've made significant progress on improving the <strong>testing</strong> story for
BeeWare apps. We've added the ability for Briefcase projects to run
normal Python test suites inside a packaged app, and we've demonstrated
that we can use this capability to run CI for iOS and Android apps (as
well as desktop platforms). This feature will be included in the next
Briefcase release.</p>
<p>Using this new testing capability, we've started building a GUI test
suite for Toga. This is a critical part of ensuring the quality of Toga
going forward; but getting this testing framework in place has revealed
lots of complications and bugs. We're making progress, but there's still
a lot of work to be done.</p>
<p>Our plans to release Toga v0.3 final have also been delayed. The process
of adding SCM-based versioning to the repository (part of the
housekeeping task) revealed a bug that prevented code running on
Android; fixing that bug became a blocker on the release of Toga v0.3.
We've now resolved that problem, so we should be able to release Toga
v0.3 final as soon as the fix has been released into the BeeWare's
Android tooling.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that leaves a lot on the Q4 TODO list. We haven't made
any changes to the example apps; Toga documentation is mostly unchanged;
we haven't been able to do any substantial Toga planning; and we haven't
been able to add any native cross-platform hardware support.</p>
<h2>Q1 priorities</h2>
<p>It's probably unsurprising that Q1 2023 will be picking up on items we
didn't get around to in Q4 2022.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Testing</strong> - Completing the Toga GUI testing suite will be our
primary focus for the quarter.</li>
<li><strong>Planning</strong> - Once we've got the test harness in place, we'll be in a
much better position to evaluate what work remains to get to v1.0.</li>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong> - The process of systematically building a test
suite also gives us an opportunity to update the API documentation for
each widget as we go. There's still lots of documentation required on
top of the API guide, but complete API documentation will be a big
start.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-platform hardware</strong> - Cross-platform support for device
hardware (especially mobile) is one of the banner features that makes
mobile device support worthwhile. Providing proof that this hardware
support is easy to use will be a key demonstrator for BeeWare as a
platform.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Longer term goals</h2>
<p>Our longer term goals are largely <a href="/ar_AR/news/buzz/2022q4-roadmap">unchanged from Q4
2022</a>. Upstreaming, Toga 1.0, and a forge for mobile
packages are all important goals for the BeeWare ecosystem. However, we
don't expect to make any significant progress on these goals until we
have solidified Toga's testing story.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The seeming lack of progress made in Q4 was definitely disappointing;
but the work hasn't been wasted. Progress has been slow specifically
because the problems we're trying to solve are hard, and reveal every
gnarled edge case that platforms have to offer. We <em>are</em> making
progress, though; and once we've got the Toga testing framework
stabilized, we'll be in a much stronger position to make predictions for
future work on Toga.</p>



  

  
  
  

  
  <h2><a href="/ar_AR/news/buzz/december-2022-status-update/">December 2022 Status Update</a></h2>
  <p class="meta">

    في 17 December 2022 
  </p>
  
  <p>This status update is a little earlier than our usual end-of-month
report because the team will be taking a well-earned break to spend time
with family and friends over the holiday and new year period. As a
result, we've got less to report than in past months; however, some
significant progress and improvements have been made.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<p>During December:</p>
<ul>
<li>We continued to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1002">fine tune Briefcase's recently added test
mode</a>. This reflects
issues that have been discovered as we continue to build Toga's GUI
test suite.</li>
<li>We updated Briefcase's Web backend to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1006">support changes made in the
2022.12.1 release of
PyScript</a>.</li>
<li>We fixed a <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/993">bug preventing the use of local file references in
requirements when building Linux
AppImages</a>. As a side
effect, this change also makes it much easier to get a debug session
inside the Docker container used to build AppImages.</li>
<li>We merged the <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1687">first draft of the Toga GUI
testbed</a>. There is still a
lot of work to be done on this testbed, but it provides a solid
foundation on which we can build tests of Toga's cross-platform GUI
behavior.</li>
<li>We added support for <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1710">mouse events on the Canvas on
GTK</a>.</li>
<li>We corrected a bug on Windows where local date formats would cause the
DateInput widget to crash.</li>
<li>We fixed <a href="https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/pull/238">a bug in Rubicon that would cause background threads to
stall on iOS</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>There won't be much more progress from the core team for the rest of
this year. We'll still be around to handle critical problems, answer
questions and do code reviews for contributors; but our response times
might be a little slower than normal. We'll publish our Q1 2023 roadmap
when we return in January - but we'll be largely picking up where this
year has left off - improving the testing story for Toga.</p>
