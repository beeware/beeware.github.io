    في 13 June 2025 
  </p>
  
  <p>Over the past semester, a team of final year students from <a href="https://www.curtin.edu.au">Curtin University</a> has been collaborating with the BeeWare Project as part of a capstone project for their degrees. Here's a summary of what they've done so far this semester, and what they have planned for the rest of the year.</p>
<h2>Curtin Capstone</h2>
<p>Capstone is the final year project undertaken by students across all computing disciplines at Curtin University, including Computer Science, Software Engineering, Cyber Security, and Information Technology. It allows students the opportunity to work in teams on real-world projects in collaboration with industry partners, gaining practical experience and professional exposure before graduating.</p>
<p>This year our team has had the exciting opportunity to contribute to BeeWare for our Capstone project.</p>
<p>Meet the Team:</p>

</ul>
<h2>What We’ve Worked On</h2>
<p>This year, our primary focus has been on improving Toga’s Web backend and enhancing Briefcase’s support for that backend.</p>
<p>Throughout the first semester, our team has been focused on contributing to issues on Briefcase and Toga while working on our research to prepare for what is to come in the following semester. We’ve also worked on implementing several of the Toga Web widgets to enhance functionality on the web backend before working on the web test suite for next semester.</p>
<p>We were first tasked with contributing to a first timer issue before moving on to other more advanced issues.</p>

</ul>
<h2>What We're Working Towards</h2>
<p>Now that we’re more familiar with the BeeWare ecosystem, through both our initial PRs and widget implementations, and having concluded our Semester 1 research phase, we’re shifting our focus to larger, more structural improvements for the second half of the project.</p>
<p>Our primary goals moving forward include:</p>
<h3>Toga Web Testing</h3>
<p>Toga does not currently support testing for the web platform as the test suite and testbed app run multithreaded in the same process. The web platform is incompatible with this as WebAssembly does not support multithreading. To address this, we are working on developing a general approach that allows the test suite and testbed app to run in separate processes. This will include using proxy objects in place of Toga objects in the test suite that will wrap the respective object in the testbed app, forwarding commands to it in order to change its state and retrieve data.</p>
<p>Additionally, to verify the rendered state of the testbed app, we plan to use Playwright to inspect the browser's DOM and compare it against what the test suite expects. This setup should allow the web platform to be effectively tested while still using the existing test suite.</p>
<p>More technical details and discussion can be found in our <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/discussions/3440">Discussion Post</a> on Toga and the associated <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/3545">Issue Ticket</a>.</p>
<h3>PyScript Briefcase and Toga Dependencies</h3>
<p>During Mitchell’s development of the DateInput Web Widget, we discovered some issues resulting from how PyScript APIs were being used. This issue was resolved separately but sparked broader discussions about the ownership of PyScript, Shoelace, and Bootstrap within the wider BeeWare architecture. Currently, the Briefcase web template includes these directly in <code>index.html</code>, but they should ideally be managed as dependencies of Toga.</p>
<p>We’re proposing to shift ownership of these dependencies to Toga and other toolkits, enabling them to define their own configurations and inserts while keeping Briefcase focused purely on packaging. This would allow for clearer version control, better modularity, and easier maintenance across the ecosystem. This approach builds on prior work (<a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1285">briefcase#1285</a>, <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1945">toga#1945</a> and <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase-web-static-template/pull/9">briefcase-web-static-template#9</a>) and introduces a mechanism for toolkit-managed inserts and configuration. We plan on reviving parts of these to allow for Toga to specify PyScript versioning.</p>
<p>More technical details and discussion can be found in our <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/discussions/2283">Discussion Post</a> on Briefcase and the associated <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2337">Issue Ticket</a>.</p>
<h3>Briefcase Web Development Optimisations</h3>
<p>While contributing to Toga's web widgets, we noticed that testing even small changes requires rebuilding all project wheels (with <code>briefcase run web -r -u</code>), which can take a significant amount of time. This makes local development slow and interrupts the feedback loop needed for efficient frontend iteration.</p>
<p>To improve this we're going to be working on extending the <code>dev</code> command to be platform aware and make it so <code>dev web</code> utilises editbale installs to serve your project to the brower making it so with simple refresh of the browser you can quickly see your changes instead of waiting for a full wheel rebuild.</p>
<p>More technical details and discussion can be found in our <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/discussions/2282">Discussion Post</a> on Briefcase and the associated <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2334">Issue Ticket</a>.</p>

  </p>
  
  <p>During May, BeeWare saw a number of major improvements - many of which came as a result of our attendance at PyCon US 2025.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul>
<li>We attended PyCon US! We gave presentations at the Language Summit and the Packaging Summit, presented a tutorial, presented in the main conference track, and spent time in the Anaconda booth demonstrating BeeWare. After all that, we ran a 3 day sprint, during which 19 new contributors earned their challenge coins, and a bunch of existing contributors returned to contribute as well. Many of the contributions described in this blog post come from PyCon US contributions.</li>
<li>Our proposed changes to <a href="https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/pull/14541">Meson</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson-python/pull/731">Meson-python</a> have all been accepted, and will be included in the next releases of those tools. There have been some other conversations with the Meson team that have led to some minor improvements in the features added to support mobile binary packaging.</li>
<li>We made a major set of updates to the BeeWare website, <a href="https://github.com/beeware/beeware.github.io/pull/629">transitioning all the content to Markdown</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/beeware/beeware.github.io/pull/637">moving the translation infrastructure to Weblate</a>.</li>
<li>We modified the Briefcase new project wizard to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2271">draw default values from a user's Git configuration, where possible</a></li>
<li>We modified Briefcase's handling of licenses to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2272">use SPDX standard abbreviations</a></li>
<li>We optimised the handling of signing on macOS to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2302">remove a redundant ad hoc signing pass when packaging an app</a></li>
<li>We improved <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2305">warnings for users who have an old version of Python</a>, which would result in them having an old version of Briefcase, but be unaware of this fact.</li>
<li>We modified Briefcase to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2308">use the system certificate store</a>. This should remove a very common source of errors on some corporate-managed VPNs. We also improved error handling to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2318">provide more context for any remaining SSL or related connection errors</a>.</li>
<li>We improved error messages when <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2303">one of the required wheels can't be found on iOS and macOS</a></li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3472">corrected the events that are generated by Tables on Windows</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3471">improved the error handling when an app doesn't return valid window content as part of its startup method</a></li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3467">added a mechanism for detecting dark mode on Android</a></li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3359">significantly improved the handling of type annotations</a>, allowing for Toga's lazy loading main module.</li>
<li>We made some modifications to the WebView widget, <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3400">adding support for setting content at time of construction</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3401">simplifying the interface for setting static content</a></li>
<li>Our student contributors have continued to work on Toga's web backend. They've added new <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3405">TimeInput</a> widget, and they've begun planning some larger contributions to Briefcase and Toga to improve the tools for testing the Web backend. There should be a blog post in a couple of weeks that details their plans for the remainder of the year.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>For most this year, we've been trying to get the pieces in place to support binary packaging on mobile platforms. We're now at a point where the code required to support iOS is mostly in place; and the code to support Android is <em>almost</em> in place; however, it will be difficult to make further progress until those changes are available in public releases.</p>
<p>So, in June, we'll be changing focus. We're aiming to take a look at Briefcase, with 2 major improvements in mind. Firstly, we want to upgrade our Windows packaging story, and upgrade our WiX support from WiX 3 to a current version. This should resolve some issues with packaging large apps and apps with lots of files; it should also enable us to package applications for ARM64. Secondly, we've had some requests to expose Briefcase's packaging and signing infrastructure so it can be used on projects that <em>aren't</em> built with Briefcase - we're hoping to add this as well.</p>
<p>We're also hoping to follow up on some of our discussion with the Python core team at PyCon, and begin the process of integrating the production of iOS and Android binary artefacts into Python releases. This will hopefully also involve integrating iOS and Android into CPython's pre-merge CI tooling, which will hopefully limit the incidence of changes that are landed into CPython that break iOS and Android.</p>
<p>Lastly, we'll continue to work on Python Emscripten support. Last month, we thought we were one issue away from a working buildbot; however, some new issues have emerged since then. We still hope to have a working buildbot before 3.14 is finalised, which will restore Emscripten to Tier 3 status.</p>
<h2>Want to get involved?</h2>
<p>Want to get involved? We curate issues that should be approachable for first-time contributors to BeeWare. They're all relatively minor changes, but would provide a big improvement to the lives of BeeWare users:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you're interested in the tooling for deploying applications to various platforms, take a look at <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22">Briefcase</a></li>
<li>Or, if you're interested in GUI widgets, take a look at <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22">Toga</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These lists can also be filtered by platform - so you can find issues that are specific to your preferred operating system. Pick one of these tickets, drop a comment on the ticket to let others know you're looking at it, and try your hand at a PR! We have a <a href="https://briefcase.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how-to/contribute-code.html">guide on setting up a Briefcase development environment</a>; but if you need any additional assistance or guidance, you can ask on the ticket, or join us on the <a href="https://beeware.org/bee/chat/">BeeWare Discord server</a>.</p>

  <p>April was a shortened development month due to the Easter break, plus
some other employer-related travel commitments, but we've still been
able to make some important progress in the BeeWare ecosystem.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul>
<li>We contributed changes to <a href="https://github.com/numpy/meson/pull/19">the Meson
buildsystem</a> that support
building on iOS; we have a <a href="https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/pull/14541">second set of
changes</a> in review. We
also have an <a href="https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson-python/pull/731">iOS support PR for
Meson-python</a>,
the library that provides the PEP 517 build interface for Meson-based
Python projects. Work on the <a href="https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/28759">patch for NumPy to support iOS
builds</a> also continued.</li>
<li>We landed some changes to CPython's iOS testbed to <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/133132">accommodate
changes introduced in Xcode
16.3</a>.</li>
<li>We modified CPython's iOS compiler shims to ensure <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/133184">better support for
enforcing minimum iOS version
levels</a>.</li>
<li>We contributed some improvements to CPython's build system to clean up
<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/133081">warnings due to over-specified linking
requirements</a>.</li>
<li>We modified CPython's usage of the HACL* hashing library to <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/133226">use a
safer memory clearing implementation on
iOS</a>.</li>
<li>We made some improvements to CPython's Android build script to <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/133193">make
it more resilient to network
failures</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/pip/25.1/">pip 25.1 was released</a>, including
support for Android packaging.</li>
<li>We completed work on a patch to allow the <a href="https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/pull/2317">declaration of tools that
are needed by the iOS build
process</a>.</li>
<li>We've submitted the first parts of a <a href="https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/pull/2349">patch to add Android build
support to
cibuildwheel</a>. This is
getting close to being ready to submit for review, but still requires
some additional work.</li>
<li>We added <a href="https://github.com/beeware/Python-Apple-support/pull/270">support for
visionOS</a>;
support for MacCatalyst <a href="https://github.com/freakboy3742/cpython/pull/8">is also
underway</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3344">updated the Textual
backend</a>. This resolved a
number of small issues that had emerged as a result of changes in
Textual.</li>
<li>Briefcase has been modified to accept <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2229">more names for change log
files</a>.</li>
<li>Briefcase can now <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2239">enforce a minimum OS version on iOS, macOS and
Android</a>. This is an
important feature for ensuring the availability of OS-level features.</li>
<li>Our student contributors have been investigating the current state of
Toga's web backend, and Briefcase's tools for running and testing that
backend. They've already landed a new
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3338">DateInput</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3362">ScrollContainer</a> widget,
and they've started the process of updating the web backend to make
better use of Pyscript APIs, <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3345">resolving a number of errors with event
handling</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>Our focus for May will be preparing for and attending PyCon US. We've
already spent some time in April getting prepared for the
<a href="https://us.pycon.org/2025/schedule/presentation/78/">talk</a> and
<a href="https://us.pycon.org/2025/schedule/presentation/147/">tutorial</a> that
we're presenting, as well as a presentation to the Language Summit; we
also hope to be attending the Packaging Summit to discuss issues related
to cross-platform build environments. We'll be around the Anaconda booth
in the main hall at various times, and we'll be at the first three days
of the sprints. Tickets are still available - we hope to see you there!</p>
<p>Allowing for travel time, just attending PyCon US will take up almost 2
weeks of May. For the rest of the month, we'll be continuing to work on
binary packaging - iOS patches for NumPy (including the tools to build
NumPy) are almost complete. Android support in cibuildwheel is also
progressing; once those changes are in place, and a cibuildwheel version
with iOS and Android support has been officially released, we will be
able to start officially submitting patches to upstream projects to
support iOS and Android.</p>
<p>Progress on Python Emscripten support stalled this month due to other
commitments. The Emscripten buildbot is still ready to launch, with one
last technical issue to resolve. We hope we'll be able to resolve this
before or at PyCon US.</p>
<h2>Want to get involved?</h2>
<p>Want to get involved? We curate issues that should be approachable for
first-time contributors to BeeWare. They're all relatively minor

  </p>
  
  <p>In Q1, BeeWare hit some major milestones for support of iOS and Android
on mobile platforms; but we still have more work to do. As always, this
roadmap should be read as a guide to what we aim to focus on over the
coming quarter, rather than a hard commitment of features that will be
made available on a specific deadline.</p>
<h2>Q1 progress</h2>
<p>In Q1, we made major progress in the state of binary packaging for iOS
and Android. PyPI now accepts binary wheel uploads; and we have uploaded
wheels for one package (pyspamsum) to prove that this support works.
We've also contributed changes in cibuildwheel that supports the
creation of iOS binary wheels. We need to wait until those changes are
in an official cibuildwheel release before we can contribute patches
upstream for other projects, but we have patches for a couple of
projects ready to submit as soon as there is an official release to use.
We've completed some preparatory work in CPython and pip to support
building Android binary wheels, but the changes to cibuildwheel to
support Android wheels are still in the early stages of development.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, our collaboration with the PyScript team didn't work out
as expected; the opportunity to work with the PyScript team that we
anticipated did not eventuate. However, a group of students from Curtin
University will be working on Toga's web backend as part of their final
year capstone project. This will include making modifications to
Briefcase to support testing web-based apps. This project will run until
the end of the year; we look forward to seeing the progress they're able
to make.</p>
<p>However, we <em>have</em> made good progress on Emscripten support in CPython.
A buildbot for Emscripten is almost ready to launch; having a stable
buildbot is a major milestone in restoring Emscripten to Tier 3 support
in CPython. Draft PEPs defining the Emscripten platform (PEP 776) and
Emscripten wheel tagging (PEP 783) are currently in discussion.</p>
<h2>Q2 priorities</h2>
<p>In Q2, we're planning to continue working on binary packaging for mobile
platforms. This work will take three forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>We'll continue working on the cibuildwheel patch to support building
Android wheels. Now that the iOS patch has landed in cibuildwheel,
we're in a position to use that patch as a template for the analogous
changes needed to support Android.</li>
<li>We'll continue to work on generating patches to third-party projects
to prove that the tooling we've developed for mobile binary wheels is
sufficient to support the entire Python ecosystem. We're currently
working on Numpy; Cryptography will likely be the next project we look
into.</li>
<li>We will start the process of formalising and standardising the work
that we've done to support iOS and Android packaging. With PyCon US
approaching rapidly, we want to get these discussions underway so that
we can make the most of the opportunity provided by having a large
portion of the Python community in one place. There are two major
areas that require formalisation - the production of official binaries
for iOS and Android support; and the state of cross-platform build
environments.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the work we're doing on mobile binary wheels, we're
expecting to work on improving Briefcase, with a view to making
Briefcase's tooling for packaging, signing and notarization useful as
standalone utilities, without the need to use Briefcase to package the
entire app.</p>
<h2>Longer term goals</h2>
<p>The long term goals of BeeWare remain largely the same. Once we've
developed a compelling story for mobile binary packaging, we'll be able
to turn our focus back to Toga. There's a number of navigation and data
organization widgets that need to be developed; we also need to improve
documentation of some common development patterns that are sources of
common questions in BeeWare support channels. Unless pull requests are
submitted from the broader community, it is unlikely that we'll make any
substantial progress on this front until the end of this year, or
perhaps early next year.</p>
<p>We're also intending to look at tooling other than <code>pip</code> and <code>venv</code> for
building Briefcase packages. Integration with Conda is one obvious goal,
as it provides rich tooling for distributing complex binary
requirements. <code>uv</code> is another tool that might fit well in the Briefcase
development story. Again, it is unlikely that we'll make any progress on
this front before the end of this year.</p>



  
  
  <h2><a href="/ar_AR/news/buzz/march-2025-status-update/">March 2025 Status Update</a></h2>

    في 2 April 2025 
  </p>
  
  <p>March has seen a big release for Toga, and a number of other notable
improvements in the BeeWare ecosystem.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/toga/0.5.0/">Toga 0.5.0 has been released</a>!
It's been over 5 months since our last feature release of Toga; this
release includes a number of major improvements to Toga's style layer,
and some significant improvements in iOS and macOS memory handling.
This release includes a number of backwards incompatible changes;
check the <a href="https://toga.readthedocs.io/en/stable/background/project/releases.html#backward-incompatible-changes">Toga 0.5.0 release
notes</a>
for details.</li>
<li>We added a new <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3114">Toga-Positron
bootstrap</a>. This bootstrap
is a Briefcase plugin that provides an easy way to start a new project
that uses a web browser as the primary UI. This is effectively the
equivalent of Electron-style apps - but the code is entirely written
in Python, and works on iOS and Android. It also allows for hybrid
apps: as the underlying app is a Toga app, you can mix Toga widgets
into the layout that is being used. The bootstrap allows you to
convert a Django website or static web server into a mobile app; it
also provides a way to generate a "single site browser" - converting a
single public URL into a standalone app on your desktop.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3273">modified the way that style properties are applied to Toga
widgets</a>. Style updates are
now applied in batch updates, dramatically reducing the amount of
repeated work required when changing the appearance of a widget.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3293">improved the UX of the Winforms Table
widget</a>, ensuring that the
selected row is still visible when a table doesn't have focus.</li>
<li>We improved Toga's <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3270">handling of the asyncio event loop on
Windows</a>. This change
ensures that Winforms apps always clean up the event loop on exit;
previously, it was possible for warnings to be raised on application
exit, caused by open sockets and unawaited co-routines.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3268">modified the handling of alignment style
properties</a> to ensure that
when text <em>direction</em> is changed, the layout of the app is
re-evaluated.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3217">added support for controlling inter-line spacing in multiline text
on a canvas</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3118">corrected some issues with background color handling on
Android</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3256">corrected some issues with supporting PyGObject on Linux
distributions that are based on Debian 12 (including Ubuntu
22.04)</a>. This was necessary
because of a backwards incompatible change introduced into the
PyGObject 3.52.1 release; unfortunately, users of older Linux
distributions may need to make some modifications to their projects.</li>
<li>The pull request <a href="https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/pull/2286">adding iOS support to
cibuildwheel</a> has been
merged. With this change, a simple package can build binary wheels for
iOS with a single command: <code>CIBW_PLATFORM=ios cibuildwheel</code>. This PR
then <a href="https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/pull/2337">required a follow-up investigation and
fix</a> to correct an
intermittent issue that was seen when running the cibuildwheel tests
in CI.</li>
<li>We've started work on a follow-up PR to cibuildwheel, <a href="https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/pull/2317">adding support
for explicitly declaring safe cross-build
tools</a>. This is a use
case that was identified during the development of PR for iOS support.</li>
<li>We corrected a <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2212">long standing issue with PTH file handling in
Briefcase</a>.</li>
<li>We added the ability to invoke <code>briefcase build</code> and
<code>briefcase package</code> on <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2201">a single application in a Briefcase
project</a>.</li>
<li>We began work on a patch to support generating iOS binary wheels for
NumPy. This is a work in progress; we've got a set of patches that
allows us to <em>compile</em> NumPy, but the test suite won't run yet.</li>
<li>We created a process to make an official <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/131532">binary release of Python for
Android</a>, which should
be available on python.org starting with Python 3.14. This will reduce
duplicated effort across Python on Android tools, and ensure binary
compatibility in the packaging ecosystem.</li>
<li>We submitted pull requests adding Android support to
<a href="https://github.com/pypa/packaging/pull/880">packaging</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/13303">pip</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>Binary packaging will continue to be an area of focus in April. In
addition to finishing the work on the "safe cross-build tools" patch, we
will continue to work on porting "real world" packages (like NumPy) to
discover any gaps that exist in the mobile packaging story. During
April, we also hope to submit a PR to support Android in cibuildwheel;
and to start a discussion with the rest of the Python packaging
community about the use of cross-platform build environments.</p>
<p>We'll also continue to work on Python Emscripten support. The Emscripten
buildbot is almost ready to launch; we have one last technical issue to
resolve, and then we'll be able to add Emscripten to the CPython
buildbot fleet.</p>
<p>There's also good news for Toga's Web backend - a group of students from
Curtin University will be working on Toga's web backend as part of their
final year capstone project. This will include making modifications to
Briefcase to support testing web-based apps. Some of the improvements to
Toga and Briefcase that landed this month are the result of those
students becoming familiar with BeeWare's contribution process. This
project will run until the end of the year; we look forward to seeing
the progress they're able to make.</p>
<p>Looking a little further ahead - in May, we'll be attending PyCon US!
We're presenting a
<a href="https://us.pycon.org/2025/schedule/presentation/78/">talk</a> and a
<a href="https://us.pycon.org/2025/schedule/presentation/147/">tutorial</a>; and
we'll be there for the first 3 days of the sprints. We'll have a
presence at the Anaconda booth in the main hall; we'll be attending
other events (such as the language summit) during the conference; and
we're hoping to plan some open spaces. Ticket sales are open - we hope
to see you there!</p>

  </p>
  
  <p>February may be the shortest month - but it's been a month of big
progress for BeeWare!</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul>
<li>The biggest news for the month is that <a href="https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/17559">it is now possible to upload
iOS and Android wheels to
PyPI</a>! This is
ultimately a very small change adding a list of allowed tags to the
underlying PyPI codebase - but it is an important step towards the
goal of having the Python ecosystem support iOS and Android as a first
class citizen.</li>
<li>We submitted a pull request <a href="https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/pull/2286">adding iOS support to
cibuildwheel</a>. With
this change, a simple package can build binary wheels for iOS with a
single command: <code>CIBW_PLATFORM=ios cibuildwheel</code>. As proof, we <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pyspamsum/1.0.7/#files">built
and published iOS wheels for a simple binary
package</a>. For
completeness, we also built and uploaded Android wheels using our
<a href="https://github.com/chaquo/chaquopy/blob/master/server/pypi/README.md">existing Chaquopy-based build
tooling</a>;
in the near future, we're hoping to replace that with a
cibuildwheel-based approach as well.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/beeware.github.io/pull/578">completed a major refactor of the BeeWare
website</a>. This
dramatically simplifies the structure of some parts of the website -
most notably, the projects page. A huge thanks to community member
<a href="https://kattni.com">Kattni</a> for all their hard work on this refactor.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://pypi.org/project/briefcase/0.3.22/">released Briefcase
0.3.22</a>. This is a bug fix
release to silence a warning raised during builds caused by the
release of pip 25.0. This warning had the potential to become an error
at an unknown point in the future, so we decided to push out a
low-feature release to avoid that possibility.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://pypi.org/project/toga/0.4.9/">released Toga 0.4.9</a>. This
release contains only 1 change over the 0.4.8 release - it imposes an
upper bound on the version of Travertino that it specifies as a
requirement. This ensures that when we release the next version of
Travertino, we don't need to accommodate compatibility with Toga 0.4
APIs.</li>
<li>We added <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3087">initial support for GTK4 to
Toga</a>. This is only the
very initial phases of GTK4 support - most widgets aren't currently
supported - but the basic infrastructure that allows a GTK4 app to
start <em>at all</em> now exists. We now need to go through the process of
porting every GTK widget for GTK4 compatibility. Thanks to the work we
did on the Toga 0.4 widget audit, we have a comprehensive test suite
that we can use to evaluate progress on this task.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2484">corrected some issues with background color handling on
Windows</a>, including adding
support for transparency on widget backgrounds. This also included
adding support for <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3140">alpha blending to
Travertino</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3181">corrected a long-standing issue that caused instability in Toga's
iOS tests</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/129200">corrected a problem with the CPython iOS test
runner</a> that
prevented multiple test runners starting at the same time, and
<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/130292">another problem that was caused when running the runner under CI
conditions</a>.</li>
<li>We upgraded the CPython iOS buildbot to run on macOS Sonoma, and Xcode
16.4; this some issues with iOS 18 compatibility that we have
resolved.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>In March we will continue to work on binary packaging. Although it is
now possible to upload binary wheels to PyPI, that capability isn't much
use unless projects are able to build those wheels in the first place.
In the process of developing the pull request for cibuildwheel, we've
identified a gap in the <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/">PEP 517</a>
specification associated with building more complex binary packages, and
a set of missing features in virtual environments in a cross-platform
build configuration. We have some ideas for how to fill these gaps; but
we need to do some more experimentation to prove that those approaches
will work as expected. The eventual goal will be to author a PEP to
address these gaps in the PEP 517 standard. We should also be able to
begin the process of adding Android binary wheel support, mirroring the
changes we've made for iOS over the past months.</p>
<p>We'll also continue to work on Python Emscripten support. The Emscripten
buildbot is almost ready to launch; we have one last technical issue to
resolve, and then we'll be able to add Emscripten to the CPython
buildbot fleet.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it looks like the work we were planning on Toga's Web
backend will be deferred. We believed we may have had an opportunity to
work with another group at Anaconda to improve Toga's web backend, but
that opportunity looks like it will not eventuate. We're still
interested in improving the web backend, but we probably won't be able
to commit significant resources to that project in the near future.</p>

Travertino's test suite to 100% branch
coverage</a>. This should make
it easier to coordinate changes in Travertino with the corresponding
changes in Toga.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3009">corrected some issues with background color handling on
iOS</a>.</li>
<li>We modified Rubicon ObjC to <a href="https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/pull/558">add support for recent changes to the way
Python manages asyncio event
loops</a>.</li>
<li>We formally published
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/setuptools-dynamic-dependencies/">setuptools-dynamic-dependencies</a>.
This is a setuptools plugin that allows dependencies to be specified
as dynamic properties. This is a tool that we've used for a while to
ensure that <code>toga-cocoa==X</code> has a dependency on <code>toga-core==X</code>; it's
now been formally published on PyPI for anyone to use.</li>
<li>We continued to work on binary iOS packaging. We're almost ready to
submit some changes to <code>cibuildwheel</code> to formally add support for
building iOS packages.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>In February, we'll continue to work on binary packaging - we hope to be
able to submit pull requests to <code>cibuildwheel</code> adding iOS support in the
coming weeks. We may also begin the process of adding Android binary
wheel support, mirroring the changes we've made for iOS.</p>
<p>We'll continue to work on Python Emscripten support. We're almost ready
to stand up an Emscripten buildbot; this may happen in February. Lastly,
we'll continue to work on Toga's Web backend, with the eventual aim of
getting the web backend to the same level of support as the other Toga
backends.</p>

  <p>Progress in Q4 was slower than anticipated, but there have been some
notable success in achieving BeeWare's overall project goals. As always,
this roadmap should be read as a guide to what we aim to focus on over
the coming quarter, rather than a hard commitment of features that will
be made available on a specific deadline.</p>
<h2>Q4 progress</h2>
<p>Our goal for Q4 was to have at least one third-party package producing
Android and iOS packages as part of their release process. We were
unable to achieve this goal, for four reasons.</p>
<p>Firstly, we underestimated the chain of downstream dependencies that
needed to be addressed before it would be possible to submit mobile
packaging PRs to upstream projects. We correctly identified <code>pip</code> and
<code>cibuildwheel</code> as two projects that would need to be updated; however,
we didn't anticipate that those projects would themselves have upstream
dependencies and issues that would require patching. The process of
coming up to speed with the development tooling of multiple upstream
projects, navigating the review processes of each of those projects, and
sequencing changes over multiple projects so they are easier to merge
has taken much longer than we anticipated.</p>
<p>Secondly, we underestimated how much work would be needed on the target
projects themselves to make them ready for mobile support. We picked
Pillow as one of our target projects because of its complex chain of
binary dependencies. However we soon discovered that the way those
binary dependencies were compiled for <em>macOS</em> required significant
alteration before working on an iOS patch would be possible.</p>
<p>Third, the release of Xcode 16 included an unexpected surprise - it
broke the mechanism we were using to gather results from test suites
running on the iOS simulator. This required a significant change in
CPython; however, as a result, we now have a much better mechanism for
collecting test results, and the test harness the CPython uses to run
its own tests can now be used to run test suites for any other Python
project.</p>
<p>Lastly, we were presented with an opportunity to work closely with the
PyScript team on web support, to the benefit of both projects. This
redirected some of the resources that we originally anticipated would be
used for Android binary packaging. However, it does mean that some
significant improvements to Toga's web backend have been made, with more
on the horizon in the new year.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, we have made significant progress. <code>pip</code> now
includes full support for iOS wheel tags. The patch adding a major
feature to <code>cibuildwheel</code> that is a pre-requisite for iOS support has
been accepted; we've been told this patch should be merged within days.
We've submitted changes to Pillow that allow macOS builds to be
completely isolated from Homebrew, and the patches required to support
cross-platform builds of Pillow's binary dependencies have been merged.
This leaves 2 patches that need to be merged - a patch to cibuildwheel
adding support for building on iOS; and the patch to Pillow adding an
iOS build configuration. These patches have been prepared, and are
mostly ready for submission upstream; using these patches, it is
possible to fully build and test Pillow wheels for iOS with
cibuildwheel.</p>
<h2>Q1 priorities</h2>
<p>In Q1, we will continue to work on binary packaging for mobile
platforms. We will continue to work on landing the patches to
<code>cibuildwheel</code> and Pillow for iOS support; once that work has concluded,
we hope to start making the analogous changes required to support
Android.</p>
<p>Q1 will also see the continuation of our collaboration with PyScript.
The major focus for BeeWare in this work will be Toga's Web backend -
and in particular, Toga's testing infrastructure. We're not currently
able to run Toga's testbed project on the web backend (or the Textual
backend, for that matter). We have some ideas for how this could be
addressed; these ideas may not be fully realised by the end of Q1, but
we hope to at least have a concrete plan, and maybe even a prototype in
place.</p>
<p>Lastly, with the CPython 3.14 development process well underway, there
are two projects that we intend to work on, with the goal of having this
work incorporated into Python 3.14. The first is the creation of
official "embedded" distributions of CPython for more platforms. Python
already produces an embedded build for Windows, and Briefcase is able to
use this distribution as part of the process of creating Windows
binaries. We hope that Python 3.14 will contain analogous builds for
macOS, iOS and Android, removing the need for BeeWare (and other
projects) to maintain independent CPython builds. We've had some initial
discussions with the CPython release team; we hope that by the end of
the quarter, we'll have a plan for how to deliver this work.</p>
<p>The second CPython feature we'd like to address is handling of
cross-platform virtual environments - that is, creating a virtual
environment that can "pretend" it is running on a different host
platform. This is necessary for cross-platform builds, which require the
ability to create an isolated PEP 517 build environment that can run
Python on the local machine, but report platform-identifying information
as if it were running on the target machine. A version of this
cross-environment virtualization has been necessary to support
<code>cibuildwheel</code>; however, it would be desirable to upstream this work so
that it can be standardised as part of a stock Python environment. We
hope to start discussions about this with the CPython core team in the
near future.</p>
<h2>Longer term goals</h2>
<p>Once we've got a strong story for packaging third-party packages for iOS
and Android, we'll be able to turn our focus back to Toga, and the work
needed to make iOS and Android compelling app development platforms.
There's a number of navigation and data organization widgets that need
to be developed; we also need to improve documentation of some common
development patterns that are sources of common questions in BeeWare
support channels.</p>
<p>We'll should also be in a position to start working on the long list of
projects in the Python ecosystem that would benefit from having iOS and
Android support upstream. <code>cryptography</code>, <code>numpy</code> and <code>pandas</code> will be
the highest priority for this work, but there's a very long tail of
useful projects that have binary modules; ideally they'd all have iOS
and Android support.</p>



  
  
  <h2><a href="/ar_AR/news/buzz/december-2024-status-update/">December 2024 Status Update</a></h2>

  </p>
  
  <p>Work in December (and the publication of this update!) was slowed by the
end-of-year break; but BeeWare still made some significant progress to
round out the year.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul>
<li>We added a <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2999">GTK implementation of Geolocation
services</a>.</li>
<li>We made a number of improvements to Pack, Toga's style API. This
includes <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3054">adding a "justify-content" style
directive</a>, <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3036">adding a "gap"
style directive</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/3033">updating a number of Pack properties to match their CSS
names</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2942">standardised the way in which Toga widgets are
instantiated</a>. This
simplifies the implementation process, and guarantees that the initial
styles added to a widget are always applied.</li>
<li>We added an API for <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2473">reporting and controlling the state of Toga
windows</a>.</li>
<li>We began modifying Toga to be <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2976">compatible with
MicroPython</a>. MicroPython
is significantly smaller than the full CPython install, reducing the
startup time for web apps.</li>
<li>We updated <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2080">Briefcase's web template to use a more recent PyScript
version</a>.</li>
<li>We added <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2089">support for console apps in the Briefcase project conversion
wizard</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2085">improved error handling when updating Briefcase
templates</a>, accounting
for some global git configuration options that were causing problems
for some users.</li>
<li>We added <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2059">explicit support for passing options to
pip</a> when installing
dependencies with Briefcase. This is mostly useful for specifying
alternative package repositories (with <code>--index-url</code> or
<code>--extra-index-url</code>) or local folders that contain wheels (with
<code>--find-links</code>); but any pip arguments can be passed down to the pip
invocation.</li>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2075">corrected an error in the default D-Bus configuration of Flatpak
apps</a>.</li>
<li>We resolved a <a href="https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/pull/543">long-standing memory management issue in
Rubicon</a>. This
change removes almost all need for manual memory management of ObjC
objects, making iOS and macOS development much more robust. It also
resolves some memory leak issues on Toga's iOS backend.</li>
<li>We added support for CPython to <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/127592">stream stdout and stderr to the
system log on iOS and
macOS</a>. This change
included a improved tool for running CPython test suites, making it
possible to stream the output of a CPython test suite while the test
suite is running, and to run the an arbitrary test suite, not just the
CPython test suite.</li>
<li>Our patch <a href="https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/pull/2062">adding a test-sources configuration in
cibuildwheel</a> has been
accepted, and should be merged in a couple of days.</li>
<li>We reviewed a large number of improvements to Emscripten support in
CPython.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>We'll publish a full Q1 roadmap in a day or two; but our goal for
January will be to continue the work we were doing in December. We'll
continue to push patches upstream to support binary packaging, with iOS
support for Pillow being the immediate goal. We'll continue to work on
Python Emscripten support, and Toga's Web backend, with the eventual aim
of getting the web backend to the same level of support as the other
Toga backends. We're planning to publish new versions of Rubicon ObjC,
Travertino and Toga in the coming days; these are major updates that
will involve some minor backwards compatibilities. Lastly, we've had a
number of reports of bugs with Briefcase's macOS notarization and
Windows packaging which we will be investigating.</p>

  </p>
  
  <p>In November, BeeWare made more good progress on mobile packaging -
however, that work has revealed a number of upstream tools that need
modification before we can contribute wheels for mobile platforms.</p>
<h2>What we've done</h2>
<ul>
<li>We attended <a href="https://2024.pycon.org.au">PyCon AU</a>; video of the talk
we gave on accessing phone hardware from Python <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLNWwNHgTco">is available on
YouTube</a>. We also had a
very productive sprint - 9 contributors earned their <a href="https://beeware.org/contributing/challenge-coins/">challenge
coin</a>, for
contributions ranging from <a href="https://github.com/beeware/beeware/pull/450">corrections to the
tutorial</a>, to the
<a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2992">addition of a dark mode flag to
Toga</a>. We also gave out one
Yak Herder coin, for someone who helps other people to get their
challenge coin. A huge thank you to everyone that came along and
participated!</li>
<li>Our patch for Pillow <a href="https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/pull/8497">isolating its build system from Homebrew when
building on macOS</a>
has been finalised and merged. This is essential for iOS support, as
it's easy for Homebrew macOS ARM64 binaries to leak into iOS builds;
but it also has benefits for macOS builds.</li>
<li>We've completed work on modifications to the Pillow build system to
support building for iOS. However, testing this work has revealed the
need for additional changes to cibuildwheel and the upstream CPython
support for iOS.</li>
<li>We've submitted a PR to cibuildwheel to <a href="https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/pull/2062">add a test-sources
configuration item</a>.
This feature is required for iOS testing, but can also be used on
other platforms, so we've contributed it independently in order to
make the iOS changes easier to test.</li>
<li>We've started work on some modifications to how the CPython iOS
testbed project is run. This has become necessary because of <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/126925">a change
introduced in Xcode
16</a>, but in order to
fix the problem, we'll also be able to <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/126821">improve the reporting of test
output during a test
run</a>, and also make
the test harness useful as a generic utility for <em>any</em> iOS project.</li>
<li>We've made good progress towards resolving a <a href="https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/pull/543">long-standing memory
management issue in
Rubicon</a>. This
change will remove almost all need for manual memory management of
ObjC objects, making iOS and macOS development much more robust.</li>
<li>We resolved a number of CPython test stability issues on Android. In
most cases, this wasn't an indicator of a broken feature, but of an
unstable test - but as a result of the extensive testing done by
CPython as a project, even a small instability can manifest as a
semi-regular test failure.</li>
<li>We've started work on <a href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2976">modifying Toga's web backend to be compatible
with Micropython</a>. This
significantly reduces the startup time for a Toga app; we're hoping to
be able to spend a lot more time on the web backend in the coming
year.</li>
<li>We've <a href="https://github.com/python/steering-council/issues/256">formally taken on responsibility for restoring Emscripten to
Tier 3 support in
CPython</a>, and
reviewed a number of patches aimed at restoring Emscripten support.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>December will be a short month because of end-of-year holidays; we'll be
continuing to work on binary packaging. The work we've done porting
Pillow to iOS has revealed a number of gaps in the tooling needed to
develop and test packages for iOS; so we will be working on getting that
upstream tooling in place, using Pillow as a demonstrator for that work.
Our overall goal hasn't changed - to get tools in place so that
third-party projects can officially support iOS and Android - but it's
become clear that there's a lot more upstream work required than we
originally anticipated. However, we'll keep working toward this goal
until creating packages for iOS and Android is as straightforward as any
other platform.</p>
<p>We'll also be continuing to work on Python Emscripten support, and
Toga's Web backend, with the eventual aim of getting the web backend to
the same level of support as the other Toga backends.</p>
