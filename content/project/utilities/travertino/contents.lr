pun:

Travertine (Travertino in Italian) is a type of limestone that has been
used as a building material for thousands of years. The name derives
from the Latin <span class="title-ref">tiburtinus</span>, meaning "of
Tibur" - Tibur being a town near Rome that was the historical source of
Travertine.

Travertine is the building material that was used to build the
Colosseum.
