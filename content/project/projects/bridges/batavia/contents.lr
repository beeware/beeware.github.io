pun:



On 27 October, 1628, *Commandeur* Francisco Pelsaert took command of the
*Batavia*, and with 340 passengers and crew, set sail from Texel.

Their destination? The Spice Islands - or more specifically, island of Java
in the Dutch East Indies (now part of Indonesia).

**The Batavia was... a Java ship (rimshot!).**

Interestingly, during the voyage, Ariaen Jacobsz and *onderkoopman* Jeronimus
Cornelisz incited a mutiny, because they didn't want to go to Java - they
wanted to escape to start a new life somewhere else. As a result of the
mutiny, on 4 June 1629, the Batavia ran aground on Morning Reef, part of the
Houtman Abrolhos, about 450km North of Perth, Western Australia, where this
project was conceived.

The `full story of the Batavia`_ is known to most Western Australian
schoolchildren, and is a harrowing tale of intrigue, savagery, and murder. *It
serves as a reminder of what can happen when you force people to go to Java*
:-)

The wreck of the Batavia was recovered in the 1970s, and now stands in the
`shipwrecks gallery of the Western Australian Maritime Museum`_.
