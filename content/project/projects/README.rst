This directory only exists for historical reasons.

It was removed in Feb 2025 as part of the content refactor in #578. However, in
order to provide redirects for historical URLs, we need to keep the content
hierarchy. Lektor doesn't support defining symlinks for images, so we also need
to duplicate all the images that were historically served from these URLs.

In a sense, this is archiving "the images as of Feb 2025" - so they shouldn't be
updated if any future rebranding occurs.
