description:

Sealang is an improved set of Python bindings for ``libclang``.

The upstream maintainers of ``libclang`` have not been especially responsive
to patches that address issues like Python 3 compatibility, and the
significant omissions in the API (such as extracting literals and operators).

This package is a fork of the official Python bindings for ``libclang``, patched to correct these problems.

How it works
-------------

Sealang is a bit of a nasty hack. ``libclang`` is a set of C bindings to a C++
API; Python ``ctypes`` are then used to wrap the C API. However, while the C++
API is quite rich, ``libclang`` is less so.

Sealang bridges this gap by providing C wrappers around the C++ calls that
provide the useful functionality. This library of C functions is wrapped up as
a Python C module for delivery purposes - this C module contains no exposed
*Python* objects or methods, but because it's a module, the underlying
compiled `sealang.so` file is easy to find. `ctypes` are then used to expose
the `sealang` wrapper functions;

Internally, Sealang reproduces some minor pieces of the ``libclang`` API;
these are methods (such as the string creation and manipulation methods) that
aren't exposed as symbols for third-party use.

All this functionality is potentially a candidate to be passed upstream to
libclang.

Relationship to Clang
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This project aims to mirror what is currently available in the Python bindings
to ``libclang``. The version number for this project is drawn from the version
and SVN revision of the official clang repository.

Any changes made upstream to ``libclang`` will be mirrored here; any changes
made here will, where possible, be pushed upstream to ``libclang``.

Development status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This project was an experiment developed to support `Seasnake </project/projects/attic/seasnake>`__. Since Seasnake has been abandoned, so has this project.
