description:


This is a meta-package for building a version of Python (and supporting libraries)
that can be embedded into an Android project.

It works by downloading, patching and building libraries in Android-compatible
format.

It currently supports the ARM-EABI, which covers most Android devices. MIPS, x86,
and ARM-v7A devices are not currently supported.

This project has been superseded by the use of `VOC </project/projects/bridges/voc>`__, which allows for Python code to be compiled for direct use on the Android platform.
