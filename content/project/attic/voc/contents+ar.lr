description:

VOC serves two major functions:

* Compiles Python 3.4+ source files into Java class files, enabling you to run
  Python code on a JVM (including Android's VM).
* Provides an API to let you programmatically create Java class files.

It isn't a *fully* compliant Python 3.4 implementation just yet - there are some
language features (like ``nonlocal`` and some builtin functions) that still need to be
implemented, and there is only a bare bones standard library implementation.
However, it is possible to convert simple Python programs, and even write
`simple Android applications`_.

To take VOC for a spin, run through the  `Getting Started`_ guide, then start with the `first tutorial`_.

If you'd like to contribute to VOC development, we have a `guide for first time contributors`_.

pun:


The `Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie (VOC)`_, or Dutch East India Company,
is often considered the be the world's first multinational corporation. It was
also the first company to issue shares, and facilitate the trading of those
shares. It was granted a 21 year monopoly to carry out trade activities in
Asia, primarily the Spice Islands - the Dutch East Indies. They established a
major trading port at Batavia - now Jakarta, on the island of Java (now part
of Indonesia). As a result of their monopoly, the VOC became an incredibly
valuable company, issuing an 18% annual dividend for almost 200 years.

VOC was... the world's first Enterprise using Java. (rimshot!)

VOC is also a backronym for "Vestigial Output Compiler". Or "Vexing Obtuse
Compiler". Or "Valuable Obscure Compiler". Or "Varigated Ocelot Calibrator".
It's your choice.
