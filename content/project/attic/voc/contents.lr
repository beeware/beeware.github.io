description:

VOC serves two major functions:

* Compiles Python 3.4+ source files into Java class files, enabling you to run
  Python code on a JVM (including Android's VM).
* Provides an API to let you programmatically create Java class files.

It isn't a *fully* compliant Python 3.4 implementation just yet - there are some
language features (like ``nonlocal`` and some builtin functions) that still need to be
implemented, and there is only a bare bones standard library implementation.
However, it is possible to convert simple Python programs, and even write
`simple Android applications`_.

To take VOC for a spin, run through the  `Getting Started`_ guide, then start with the `first tutorial`_.

If you'd like to contribute to VOC development, we have a `guide for first time contributors`_.

pun:

VOC is a backronym for "Vestigial Output Compiler". Or "Vexing Obtuse
Compiler". Or "Valuable Obscure Compiler". Or "Varigated Ocelot Calibrator".
It's your choice.

Historically, VOC was the `Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie (VOC)`_, or Dutch
East India Company, often considered the be the world's first multinational
corporation. It was also the first company to issue shares, and facilitate the
trading of those shares. It was granted a 21 year monopoly to carry out trade
activities in Asia, primarily the Spice Islands - the Dutch East Indies. They
established a major trading port at Batavia - now Jakarta - on the island of
Java (now part of Indonesia).

While VOC was a very profitable business for it's shareholders, it operated as
a colonial power. Modern historians have `expressed criticism of their business
practices`_, which included exploitation of indigenous populations (including
use of slave labour), slave trade, use of violence, and environmental
destruction (including deforestation).

VOC also played a role in the European discovery of Australia, and there are
many VOC shipwrecks on the coast of Western Australia.

The name VOC was chosen by the project because the project founder is from
Western Australia, and VOC has a strong non-colonial presence in that state's
history. It was also a convenient pun, as VOC was an enterprise Java company.

It should not be considered an endorsement or glorification of the
exploitative business practices of the company.
