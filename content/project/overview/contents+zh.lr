title: BeeWare 是什麼？
---
body:


Python has proven itself as a highly capable language - approachable for newcomers, but powerful in the hands of experts. The BeeWare Project aims to take the power of Python as a language, and use it to enable users of all skill levels to develop applications with native user interfaces.

The end goal of the BeeWare project: To be able to do for mobile and desktop user-facing software the same thing that Django has done for web software - to put into the hands of users a set of tools and libraries that enables them to develop rich, native user interfaces, and deploy them to their devices. This includes:

* Tools to enable Python to run on different devices,
* Tools to package a Python project so it can run on those devices,
* Libraries to access the native widgets and capabilities of devices,
* Tools to help develop, debug, analyze and deploy these projects.

This aim is that this set of tools will be easy enough to use for complete newcomers to use in a Django Girls-like setting; but powerful enough that they could be used to drive the next Instagram, Pinterest or Disqus.

We're not just about software, though. We also aim to be a project with a social conscience. We aim to develop and maintain a diverse and inclusive community, and we have a Code of Conduct that is rigorously enforced. We also aspire to develop a healthy and sustainable community - one that is aware of mental health issues of its participants, and provides the resources for people to start engaging, and continue to engage with the community.
