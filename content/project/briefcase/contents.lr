description:

Briefcase is a tool for converting a Python project into a standalone
native application. You can package projects for:

- macOS (as a `.app` bundle, `DMG` archive or `PKG` installer)
- Windows (as a `.zip`, or an `MSI` installer)
- Linux (as a Flatpak, or a `.rpm`, `.deb`, or `.pkg.zip` system native
  package)
- iPhone/iPad
- Android
- Web

Support for AppleTV, watchOS, and wearOS is planned.

If you want to see Briefcase in action, try the [BeeWare
tutorial](https://beeware.readthedocs.io). That tutorial walks you
through the process of creating and packaging a new application with
Briefcase.
