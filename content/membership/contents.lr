Once-off contributions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Memberships are our preferred way to support BeeWare, as they provide income stability over time. However, we understand that this isn't always compatible with some budgets or corporate expense processes.

If you can't (or don't want to) become a member of the BeeWare project, you can make a once-off financial contribution.

.. raw:: html

    <a class="gumroad-button" href="https://gum.co/YilPM" target="_blank">Make a once-off contribution</a>

If the size of a once-off contributions meets or exceeds the value of a 12 month subscription, you'll be eligible to the benefits of that subscription level.

Other options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you'd like to talk to someone about other branding or sponsorship opportunities, or you'd like other payment options for your membership, please direct enquiries to `Russell Keith-Magee <mailto:russell@beeware.org>`__.
