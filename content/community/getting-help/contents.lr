We have a number of communication channels if you need to get in touch.

Real-time chat
---------------

We use `Discord </bee/chat/>`__ for real-time communication.

Discussion and bugs
--------------------

A lot of project-specific communication happens on the Issues for the specific project. Check the `Project </project>`__ list for specific project links.

We also use Github Discussions as a forum to discuss projects. If you have a question about how to use a BeeWare tool, open a discussion thread in the repository for that tool.

Direct Questions to Core Contributors

If you need direct help and don't feel comfortable using a public forum, please feel free to get in contact with any `Core Contributor </about/team/>`__, either by email, Twitter, Mastodon, or Discord.
