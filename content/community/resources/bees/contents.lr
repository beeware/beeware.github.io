description:

Cross-platform application development is a holy grail of software
engineering. Write once, run everywhere - desktops, mobiles, and the
web. There have been many attempts at this over the years, but the
absolute pinnacle of this art form is to have no-one notice - you want
your apps to look and feel like native apps so that your users can't
tell. Bonus points is if your development happens in a language you
already know and use. This is the goal of BeeWare: a suite of
application tools and libraries that to develop native cross platform
applications in Python. During this short presentation Katie will take
you on a tour of the BeeWare stack, and describe how we've used the
project as an incubator for new open source contributors around the
world.

(The talk was unfortunately not recorded, but Katie has recorded a
screencast for us!)
