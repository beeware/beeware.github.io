Could you write me a Python app for the wide range of platforms out there? Oh, wait, I want them to be native GUI applications. And I need them on mobile (Android, iOS, tvOS, and watchOS) as well as major desktop apps. I also need them to appear indistinguishable from native apps (be a .app on macOS, .exe on Windows, etc).

What technology would you use for this? This week I'll introduce you to a wide set of small, focused and powerful tools that make all of this, and more, possible. We're speaking with Russell Keith-Magee, founder of the Beeware project.
