title: Beyond Web 2.0 - Django and Python in the modern web ecosystem
---
description:

Django is over 10 years old; but the web that it was built for - the
world of "Web 2.0" - doesn't really exist any more. Yes, we still need
to rapidly develop database-backed websites, AJAX-enabled, but the
modern web is faced with new problems and new challenges. Many of those
challenges involve interacting with devices that aren't desktop
machines, and platforms that aren't a traditional browser - places where
Python isn't a first-class citizen.

Does this mean we have to abandon Django and Python for other frameworks
and languages? Can we keep using Python and Django on the server side
and interact with independent client side frameworks? Or can we push
Python and Django into these new environments?

In this talk, Dr Russell Keith-Magee will explore the problems, and the
potential solutions, to these problems.
