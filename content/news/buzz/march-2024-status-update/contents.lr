This month, we have less to report by raw feature count - but the
changes we *have* made represent extremely significant progress.

## What we've done

- Our primary focus this month has been making the changes to CPython
  needed to add support for
  [iOS](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/114099) and
  [Android](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/116622). We've made
  major progress towards this goal: all the patches required for iOS
  have been merged; a large number of patches have been submitted for
  Android, with only a small number still required. This month, we have:
  - [Added test exclusions to support running the test suite on
    Android](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/115918)
  - [Fixed some issues with the process of building an Android
    libPython](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/115955)
  - [Modified sys.platform identification for Android so it returns
    "android" not
    "linux"](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/116215)
  - [Added an API to get device and OS information on
    Android](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/116674)
  - [Modified ctypes so it can load libraries on
    Android](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/116379)
  - [Modified a signals test to make it more reliable on more
    platforms](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/116423)
  - [Added a build script and instructions for Android
    builds](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/116426)
  - [Added a custom module loader so that iOS apps can load binary
    modules from
    Frameworks](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/116454)
  - [Modified test\_doctest to support platforms that don't support
    subprocesses](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/116758)
  - [Modified the standard library to support
    iOS](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/117052)
  - [Added documentation for the iOS
    platform](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/117057)
  - [Corrected some additional test failures introduced on
    Android](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/117299)
- [PEP 738](https://peps.python.org/pep-0738/), adding official Android
  support to CPython, has been formally approved by the Python Steering
  Council.
- We [updated the CPython Developer Guide to describe the iOS
  development process](https://github.com/python/devguide/pull/1296).
- We [improved Briefcase's handling of stdout for some
  tools](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1687). We're hoping
  this will fix - or at least make it easier to diagnose - a mode of
  failure we've had reported for the Android emulator on Windows.
- We added [color to Android's log
  output](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1676).
- We [corrected the handling of key shortcuts on Window and
  GTK](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2415), adding a lot of key
  combinations that weren't previously possible to represent.
- We [restructured the Toga documentation landing
  page](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2463), making it easier to
  find the documentation you're likely to need.
- We landed the [MapView
  widget](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2379), and have completed
  most of the work on a new [Geolocation
  service](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2462).

## What's next?

In April, we're hoping to wrap up the work on iOS and Android patches
for CPython, and add buildbots for those platforms. With the buildbots
in place, iOS and Android will officially be Tier 3 supported CPython
platforms. We also plan to revisit the BeeWare tutorial, adding some
more steps in preparation for a [tutorial presentation at PyCon
US](https://us.pycon.org/2024/schedule/presentation/41/) in May. If
you're coming to Pittsburgh and you'd like to attend that tutorial
session, [ticket sales are
open!](https://us.pycon.org/2024/attend/information/)

## Want to get involved?

Want to get involved? Here are some open issues that would be a great
place to get started with contributing to a BeeWare project. They're all
relatively minor changes, but would provide a big improvement to the
lives of BeeWare users:

1.  [Update the Toga testbed test suite to use Pixel 7 Pro device
    sizes](https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/2251)
2.  [Filter out a message generated after Xcode
    updates](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/780)
3.  [Add the ability to configure the ABIs built by an Android
    project](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/808)
4.  [Rationalise the application of adhoc signing on
    macOS](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1099)
5.  [Add support for custom PyPI
    repositories](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1270)
6.  [Document how to debug an application in popular
    IDEs](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1393)
7.  [Correctly handle incomplete project
    deletions](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/394)
8.  [Add an option to select the Android base image when creating new
    emulators](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/737)
9.  [Print notarisation log failures when building macOS
    apps](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1472)
10. [Add an API to replace a child of a
    widget](https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/2301)
11. [Add an API to entirely replace the style of a
    widget](https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/2305)
12. [Add the ability to define content when creating a
    window](https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/2307)

Pick one of these tickets, drop a comment on the ticket to let others
know you're looking at it, and try your hand at a PR! We have a [guide
on setting up a Briefcase development
environment](https://briefcase.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how-to/contribute-code.html);
but if you need any additional assistance or guidance, you can ask on
the ticket, or join us on the [BeeWare Discord
server](https://beeware.org/bee/chat/).
