title: 2024Q2 Roadmap

body:

Q1 2024 has seen some major progress - but as always, there's still
plenty of work to do. As always, this roadmap should be read as a guide
to what we aim to focus on over the coming quarter, rather than a hard
commitment of features that will be made available on a specific
deadline.

## Q1 progress

The first quarter of 2024 has seen significant progress towards getting
iOS and Android to Tier 3 supported status in CPython. [PEP
738](https://peps.python.org/pep-0738/) has been formally accepted by
the CPython steering committee, and the vast majority of the changes
needed to support [iOS](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/114099)
and [Android](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/116622) have
either been merged, or received substantial review from the CPython core
team.

We've also made progress on a number of long standing feature requests
in Toga. We've added an OptionContainer for Android, so tab-based UIs
can be used on all platforms. We've added a MapView widget that works on
all desktop and mobile platforms. We've also added the start of hardware
APIs, including Camera and Geolocation APIs.

## Q2 priorities

Our Q2 goals are:

- **Get iOS and Android to Tier 3 supported status**. We expect to
  finish upstreaming the patches we have for CPython early in the
  quarter. However, Tier 3 status also requires CI infrastructure to
  verify that the platforms are stable. In Q2, we will commission
  buildbots so that CPython's CI is able to verify the ongoing stability
  of iOS and Android as a platform.
- **Extend the BeeWare tutorial**. The BeeWare tutorial provides a good
  introduction to using Briefcase and Toga, but there are a number of
  common support questions that aren't covered by the tutorial, and some
  features that we've added since the tutorial last saw significant
  edits. We're going to revisit the tutorial, adding some extra steps to
  cover these new features and common issues.
- **Attend PyCon US 2024** We're presenting a tutorial and a talk; we
  will have a booth in the community section; we'll be there for the
  full duration of the sprints; and we're also expecting to attend the
  language summit. It's going to be a busy 2 weeks - we hope we see you
  there!
- **Start working on packaging for mobile platforms**. PEP 730 and PEP
  738 cover the core of CPython itself, but Python is much more than
  just the core interpreter and standard library. There's also the
  ecosystem of third-party libraries, many of which have binary
  components. In this quarter, we're going to start looking at the
  changes that are needed to make it easy for the community to start
  packaging wheels for iOS and Android.
- **Modify the App class to support other types of apps**. This includes
  adding an API for a "Simple App" that doesn't have a menu bar,
  finalising the API for document-based apps, and providing an API for
  system tray apps.

## Longer term goals

Completing PEP 730 and 738 is a major milestone - but there's still a
lot of work to be done. It will take a lot of time and community
education before iOS and Android binary packages are widely available.
We intend to do whatever we can to support the community, ranging from
documentation, to tooling support, to submitting patches to upstream
packages.

One of the ways to accelerate this transition will be to make iOS and
Android compelling platforms to support. This means adding more
capabilities to Toga, so that there aren't any capability gaps for a
user writing an app. It also means writing more documentation and
tutorials so that common app development tasks are well explained.

## Summary

This month marks 2 years since full-time work began on BeeWare; and 10
years since the first commits on the project. We've come a long way in
that time - from a collection of cobbled-together proof of concept
demonstrators to a fully tested GUI platform, with equally tested
deployment tooling, and official support in CPython itself. The future
for Python as a GUI development platform on desktop and mobile has never
looked better, and we're excited to see what the coming years will
bring.
