Although there haven't been a lot of new BeeWare features developed in
February, the work that has been completed represents some important
progress against our overall project goals.

## What we've done

- The biggest milestone is that we have achieved 100% test coverage for
  our first widget -
  [Button](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1761)! This may sound a
  little underwhelming - after all, Toga has had a Button widget for a
  long time, and has been fairly reliable. However, getting to this
  point has required a lot of smaller (seemingly unrelated) problems to
  be solved. It has also required setting up all the infrastructure that
  will be necessary to test every other widget, such as defining the
  probes to inspect colors and fonts, and to ensure that the GUI
  framework has finished applying changes before performing a test
  assertion). We've also taken this opportunity to start migrating the
  Toga unit tests to `pytest`, which promises to significantly improve
  our testing capabilities.
- We [formalised the relationship between Toga's Pack layout model and
  CSS](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1778). This should make it a
  lot easier to determine what "correct" layout behavior should be.
- We [identified a low level issue with the way that layout is performed
  on GTK, and possibly with other
  platforms](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1794). We're still
  working through the consequences of this change, but it has indirectly
  resolved a number of issues we have seen reported with widget layouts,
  especially on GTK.
- We've added the [ability to pass command line arguments to running
  apps](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1078) from the
  `briefcase dev` and `briefcase run` interface. This was primarily done
  to make it easier to run unit test suites; but it can be used for any
  other reason you might want to use a command line argument.
- We have a [draft implementation of a Linux system packaging
  backend](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1106) for
  Briefcase. We've had consistent problems with both AppImage and
  Flatpak, most of which can be traced back to resolving links to system
  packages. We're not going to remove these backends - when AppImage and
  Flatpak work, they're great options - but we're going to change the
  default packaging backend on Linux to be system packages (i.e.,
  DEB/RPM etc). This makes the simple case of building a package for
  your own system much easier, while retaining the ability to build
  packages for other distributions as required. We're hoping to land
  this PR in the coming month.
- We [corrected an issue with threading
  modes](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1102) that prevented
  some Windows apps (especially PySide/Qt apps) from displaying dialogs.
- We [corrected an issue with the Briefcase Web
  backend](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1113) that would
  cause intermittent errors when loading a web app.
- We updated our CI infrastructure to make better use of shared task
  definitions. BeeWare has a lot of GitHub repositories, and a lot of
  common tasks (such as rolling out an app across multiple Python and
  operating system versions). Previously, each GitHub repository had an
  independent set of CI task definitions; we've now got a central
  collection of task definitions that is used by all repositories.
- We cleaned up the [table in Toga's documentation describing the state
  of support of each widget](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1762).
  This allows us to differentiate between widgets that we've fully
  tested, and widgets that exist, but haven't been tested.
- Thanks to a community contribution, we've been able to [publish a
  backlog of iOS binary packages for Python
  3.8-3.11](https://github.com/freakboy3742/chaquopy/pull/4). For the
  packages we currently support (including Numpy, Pandas, Pillow and
  more), we're now able to offer an iOS binary wheel for every published
  version for which there is a corresponding macOS wheel, going back to
  2019.

## What's next?

In March, we'll be continuing to improve GUI test coverage. Now that
we've got one widget to 100% coverage, we know we have all the core
testing infrastructure in place, so it should be much easier to
implement tests for the future widgets. By the end of March, we should
have a lot more widgets at 100% coverage.

We'll also be presenting at [Everything Open
2023](https://2023.everythingopen.au). If you're attending, come say hi!

## Want to get involved?

Want to get involved? Here are some open issues that would be a great
place to get started with contributing to a BeeWare project. They're all
relatively minor changes, but would provide a big improvement to the
lives of BeeWare users:

1.  [Modify the handling of app signing
    options](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/865)
2.  [Filter out a message generated after Xcode
    updates](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/780)
3.  [Add the ability to refresh the support package in a
    project](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/856)
4.  [Provide protection against creating projects with "semi-reserved"
    names](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/853)
5.  [Add the ability to configure the ABIs built by an Android
    project](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/808)
6.  [Add support for the ANDROID\_HOME environment
    variable](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/463)
7.  [Add a template branch option when creating a new
    project](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1053)
8.  [Improve validation of project names in the Briefcase
    wizard](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1011)
9.  [Rationalise the application of adhoc signing on
    macOS](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1099)
10. [Correct the capture of log messages on the web
    backend](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1090)

Pick one of these tickets, drop a comment on the ticket to let others
know you're looking at it, and try your hand at a PR! We have a [guide
on setting up a Briefcase development
environment](https://briefcase.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how-to/contribute-code.html);
but if you need any additional assistance or guidance, you can ask on
the ticket, or join us on the [BeeWare Discord server](/bee/chat/).
