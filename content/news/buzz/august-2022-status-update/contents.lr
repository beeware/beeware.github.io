The main focus of the BeeWare team during August was binary module
support on mobile platforms. Although we haven't got the final results
of this work yet, we have significant progress to report for both iOS
and Android. We've also had a number of other improvements land over the
course of the month.

## What we've done

During August:

- We have continued to work on the changes needed to migrate Android
  support to Chaquopy. This has included some [major changes to the
  Android Gradle
  template](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase-android-gradle-template/pull/52),
  and developing a Rubicon Java compatibility layer. Eventually, Toga
  will migrate to use the Chaquopy APIs directly, but in the interim,
  the Rubicon APIs will continue to work.
- We have started updating Chaquopy to support multiple Python versions.
  Historically, Chaquopy has only supported a single Python3 version
  (3.8); for compatibility with Briefcase, we are adding support for
  Python 3.9 and 3.10, as well as preparing the ground for a 3.11
  release when Python 3.11 is finalised.
- We have modified the Python Apple support packages to [provide the
  binary portions of the Python standard library as dynamically loaded
  binary
  modules](https://github.com/beeware/Python-Apple-support/pull/161),
  and modified the
  [iOS](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase-iOS-Xcode-template/pull/7)
  and
  [macOS](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase-macOS-Xcode-template/pull/10)
  templates to use and sign these binary modules. These changes haven't
  landed yet, but they have been tested on simulators and physical
  devices. Along the way, we've also updated the support packages to use
  OpenSSL 3.
- We have modified Briefcase to [make the Python support package
  optional](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/805), at the
  discretion of the project template. This was needed because Chaquopy
  provides the Python library using a Gradle plugin, rather than
  requiring a project to source a pre-compiled support package.
- We have addressed an issue with the way Briefcase handles
  [requirements references when they are relative file
  references](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/816). Although
  this was added to allow rapid debugging of changes to Toga on Android,
  it also affected the recently added Linuxdeploy backend.
- We've [added an "open" subcommand to
  Briefcase](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/846), making it
  easier to open project-based templates in their respective IDEs.
- We've [improved Android log
  handling](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/821), ensuring
  that more app-specific logs are displayed to the user.
- We've [dramatically improved our CI testing of
  Briefcase](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/844). We now
  build an app on every platform we support, using every backend.
- We've addressed a number of bugs in the Pack layout algorithm.
- We've continued the process of making Toga widget APIs naming
  internally consistent.
- We've fixed some canvas bugs that were causing problems on Windowns
  with our native Matplotlib rendering backend,
  [toga-chart](https://github.com/beeware/toga-chart).
- We've addressed some bugs associated with [changing the main content
  of a Toga window](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1572).
- We added an [initial implementation of a DetailedList widget on
  Windows](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1574).

## What's next?

In September, we hope to wrap up the work on binary dependencies. On
Android, this is mostly a matter of completing the work to support
multiple Python versions. On iOS, we need to develop the tools to manage
the compilation of third-party binary libraries. We have an initial
proof of concept of this; we need to finish these tools, and develop the
infrastructure to distribute. We're also hoping to start conversations
with the Anaconda team about Conda integration with Briefcase, and start
improving GUI testing in Toga.
