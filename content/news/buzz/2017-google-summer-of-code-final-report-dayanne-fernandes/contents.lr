title: 2017 Google Summer of Code - Port Cricket to use Toga, instead of Tkinter
---
author: Dayanne Fernandes

body:

After almost 4 months of work on [Google Summer of
Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/) 2017, finally I'm
completing my proposal. Every widget migration and every
commit/PR/issue/discussion with my mentors about
[Cricket](/project/applications/cricket/) , [Toga](/project/toga/) and
[rubicon-objc](/project/utilities/rubicon/) were detailed on the [Issue
58](https://github.com/beeware/cricket/issues/58).

## "Eating your own dog food"

The best way to show that a product is reliable to the customers is use
it. So, the way to show that [Toga](/project/toga/) is an effective tool
to build a GUI is to build a complete application using it.

[Cricket](/project/applications/cricket/) is a graphical tool that helps
you run your test suites. Its current version is implemented using
[Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/2/library/tkinter.html) as the main
GUI framework. So, why not test [Toga](/project/toga/) inside of another
product from [BeeWare](https://beeware.org)? That's what I have
accomplished during my GSoC work.

## Results

The proposal focus not only on the port of
[Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/2/library/tkinter.html) to
[Toga](/project/toga/), but on mapping the necessary widgets for a real
application using [Toga](/project/toga/) framework. To help me to map
this I studied more about
[Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/2/library/tkinter.html),
[Toga](/project/toga/), [Colosseum](/project/utilities/colosseum/),
[rubicon-objc](/project/utilities/rubicon/),
[Objective-C](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec),
[Cocoa](http://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/General/Conceptual/DevPedia-CocoaCore/Cocoa.html)
and [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/).

The work I did during GSoC were sent through the [PR
65](https://github.com/beeware/cricket/pull/65), reported on the [Issue
58](https://github.com/beeware/cricket/issues/58) and the final
demonstration of the work can be seen in this
[link](https://youtu.be/5kz_CmQYFYE). There were widgets used on
[Cricket](/project/applications/cricket/) that weren't ready yet on
[Toga](/project/toga/), so some improvements were necessary on
[Toga](/project/toga/) so that I could use them on
[Cricket](/project/applications/cricket/). In summary here are some PRs
and issues that I contributed to get my work done in
[Cricket](/project/applications/cricket/):

## Future Plans

There are some features on [Cricket](/project/applications/cricket/)
that I want to help develop in a near future, for example:

- A button to refresh all the tests tree
- Cricket settings

Also, there are some issues remained after this migration to
[Toga](/project/toga/). These issues will be fixed on
[Toga](/project/toga/) widgets in a near future too, for example:

- A gap between the output and error boxes when there is no output
  message
- Run a test if the user click on it

I truly believe that [Toga](/project/toga/) will be the official
framework on Python to build GUI for multiplatforms applications, so
I'll continue to contribute to this project because I want to use in
every application that I would need a GUI.

## Final Considerations

I would like to truly thank my mentors [Russell
Keith-Magee](https://github.com/freakboy3742) and [Elias
Dorneles](https://github.com/eliasdorneles) for guide and help me so
much during this period. The opportunity to be part of this community
was a great honor to me, thank you so much to accept me in this program
[Russell Keith-Magee](https://github.com/freakboy3742). Also, I want to
thank [Philip James](https://github.com/phildini) that made some reviews
in my PRs and [Jonas Schell](https://github.com/Ocupe) that fixed one
issue that I sent to [Toga](/project/toga/).
