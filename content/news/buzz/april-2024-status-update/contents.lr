This month has seen BeeWare reach one major milestone, almost reach a
second, as well as landing several smaller improvements.

## What we've done

- iOS is [officially a Tier 3 supported platform for
  CPython](https://peps.python.org/pep-0011/#tier-3)! All the patches
  needed to support iOS have been merged, and a [buildbot has been
  deployed](https://buildbot.python.org/all/#/builders/1380) to verify
  that CPython can run on iOS. As a result, [PEP 730 has been moved into
  "Final" status](https://peps.python.org/pep-0730/).
- Android support in CPython is getting very close to completion. The
  last three patches (adding a [test harness for running the test suite
  on Android](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/117878),
  [redirecting stdout and stderr to the Android
  log](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/118063), and [updating
  sysconfig to support
  Android](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/118352)) are currently
  in review; once those have been merged, and a buildbot has been
  deployed, Android should also be at Tier 3 status.
- We landed a new [Geolocation service for
  Toga](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2462), providing access to
  GPS data on mobile devices and macOS.
- We made some [modifications to how Toga handles application
  icons](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2527), removing the need
  to duplicate the icon in application data. These changes are in final
  review.
- We added a new wizard to [add a Briefcase configuration to an existing
  Python project](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1231).
- We [modified how Briefcase handles splash screens on mobile
  devices](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1751), and
  corrected some issues with icons seen on recent Android releases.
- We [corrected a problem in Rubicon
  ObjC](https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/pull/446) caused by a
  change to the `ctypes` module in CPython 3.13. It might be possible to
  upstream this fix to CPython itself; but for now, Rubicon ObjC is able
  to support Python 3.13.0a6.
- We drafted a new tutorial step about [customising application
  appearance](https://github.com/beeware/beeware/pull/327). This update
  is in review, and should be live in the near future.

## What's next?

The bulk of May will be taken up by preparing for and attending PyCon
US. We're presenting a
[talk](https://us.pycon.org/2024/schedule/presentation/40/) and a
[tutorial](https://us.pycon.org/2024/schedule/presentation/41/); we're
also [presenting at the Language
Summit](https://us.pycon.org/2024/events/language-summit/), we will have
a booth in the community section of the Expo Hall, and we'll be there
for the first 3 days of the sprints. If you're coming to Pittsburgh and
you'd like to attend that tutorial session, [ticket sales are
open!](https://us.pycon.org/2024/attend/information/). We're also hoping
that we'll be able to wrap up the work on Android support in CPython,
and start work on supporting command line applications in Briefcase.

## Want to get involved?

Want to get involved? Here are some open issues that would be a great
place to get started with contributing to a BeeWare project. They're all
relatively minor changes, but would provide a big improvement to the
lives of BeeWare users:

1.  [Update the Toga testbed test suite to use Pixel 7 Pro device
    sizes](https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/2251)
2.  [Filter out a message generated after Xcode
    updates](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/780)
3.  [Add the ability to configure the ABIs built by an Android
    project](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/808)
4.  [Rationalise the application of adhoc signing on
    macOS](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1099)
5.  [Add support for custom PyPI
    repositories](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1270)
6.  [Document how to debug an application in popular
    IDEs](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1393)
7.  [Correctly handle incomplete project
    deletions](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/394)
8.  [Add an option to select the Android base image when creating new
    emulators](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/737)
9.  [Print notarisation log failures when building macOS
    apps](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1472)
10. [Add an API to replace a child of a
    widget](https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/2301)
11. [Add an API to entirely replace the style of a
    widget](https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/2305)
12. [Add the ability to define content when creating a
    window](https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/2307)

Pick one of these tickets, drop a comment on the ticket to let others
know you're looking at it, and try your hand at a PR! We have a [guide
on setting up a Briefcase development
environment](https://briefcase.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how-to/contribute-code.html);
but if you need any additional assistance or guidance, you can ask on
the ticket, or join us on the [BeeWare Discord
server](https://beeware.org/bee/chat/).
