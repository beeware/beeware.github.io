title: 2023Q1 Roadmap

body:

Welcome to a new year! 2022 saw some amazing progress for BeeWare; and
we've got some big plans for 2023. As always, this roadmap should be
read as a guide to what we aim to focus on over the coming quarter,
rather than a hard commitment of features that will be made available on
a specific deadline.

## Q4 progress

Progress in Q4 was not as significant as we originally planned. A
combination of conference travel and holiday leave meant the quarter was
shorter than most; but even then, our goals for the quarter were
extremely optimistic.

We were able to hit our goal for **Web deployment**. We've restored the
Toga web backend to a working state, and we've added a Web deployment
backend to Briefcase. There's still a lot of work required before Web
deployment is a viable as a production solution, but the initial pieces
are now in place.

We were also able to hit our goals on **housekeeping**. We've made a lot
of improvements to the base infrastructure of repositories, enabling
Black, pre-commit, and towncrier in Toga, and improving coverage
reporting (including getting to 100% branch coverage in Briefcase's test
suite).

We've made significant progress on improving the **testing** story for
BeeWare apps. We've added the ability for Briefcase projects to run
normal Python test suites inside a packaged app, and we've demonstrated
that we can use this capability to run CI for iOS and Android apps (as
well as desktop platforms). This feature will be included in the next
Briefcase release.

Using this new testing capability, we've started building a GUI test
suite for Toga. This is a critical part of ensuring the quality of Toga
going forward; but getting this testing framework in place has revealed
lots of complications and bugs. We're making progress, but there's still
a lot of work to be done.

Our plans to release Toga v0.3 final have also been delayed. The process
of adding SCM-based versioning to the repository (part of the
housekeeping task) revealed a bug that prevented code running on
Android; fixing that bug became a blocker on the release of Toga v0.3.
We've now resolved that problem, so we should be able to release Toga
v0.3 final as soon as the fix has been released into the BeeWare's
Android tooling.

Unfortunately, that leaves a lot on the Q4 TODO list. We haven't made
any changes to the example apps; Toga documentation is mostly unchanged;
we haven't been able to do any substantial Toga planning; and we haven't
been able to add any native cross-platform hardware support.

## Q1 priorities

It's probably unsurprising that Q1 2023 will be picking up on items we
didn't get around to in Q4 2022.

- **Testing** - Completing the Toga GUI testing suite will be our
  primary focus for the quarter.
- **Planning** - Once we've got the test harness in place, we'll be in a
  much better position to evaluate what work remains to get to v1.0.
- **Documentation** - The process of systematically building a test
  suite also gives us an opportunity to update the API documentation for
  each widget as we go. There's still lots of documentation required on
  top of the API guide, but complete API documentation will be a big
  start.
- **Cross-platform hardware** - Cross-platform support for device
  hardware (especially mobile) is one of the banner features that makes
  mobile device support worthwhile. Providing proof that this hardware
  support is easy to use will be a key demonstrator for BeeWare as a
  platform.

## Longer term goals

Our longer term goals are largely [unchanged from Q4
2022](../2022q4-roadmap). Upstreaming, Toga 1.0, and a forge for mobile
packages are all important goals for the BeeWare ecosystem. However, we
don't expect to make any significant progress on these goals until we
have solidified Toga's testing story.

## Summary

The seeming lack of progress made in Q4 was definitely disappointing;
but the work hasn't been wasted. Progress has been slow specifically
because the problems we're trying to solve are hard, and reveal every
gnarled edge case that platforms have to offer. We *are* making
progress, though; and once we've got the Toga testing framework
stabilized, we'll be in a much stronger position to make predictions for
future work on Toga.
