title: December 2022 Status Update

author: Russell Keith-Magee

body:

This status update is a little earlier than our usual end-of-month
report because the team will be taking a well-earned break to spend time
with family and friends over the holiday and new year period. As a
result, we've got less to report than in past months; however, some
significant progress and improvements have been made.

## What we've done

During December:

- We continued to [fine tune Briefcase's recently added test
  mode](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1002). This reflects
  issues that have been discovered as we continue to build Toga's GUI
  test suite.
- We updated Briefcase's Web backend to [support changes made in the
  2022.12.1 release of
  PyScript](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1006).
- We fixed a [bug preventing the use of local file references in
  requirements when building Linux
  AppImages](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/993). As a side
  effect, this change also makes it much easier to get a debug session
  inside the Docker container used to build AppImages.
- We merged the [first draft of the Toga GUI
  testbed](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1687). There is still a
  lot of work to be done on this testbed, but it provides a solid
  foundation on which we can build tests of Toga's cross-platform GUI
  behavior.
- We added support for [mouse events on the Canvas on
  GTK](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1710).
- We corrected a bug on Windows where local date formats would cause the
  DateInput widget to crash.
- We fixed [a bug in Rubicon that would cause background threads to
  stall on iOS](https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/pull/238).

## What's next?

There won't be much more progress from the core team for the rest of
this year. We'll still be around to handle critical problems, answer
questions and do code reviews for contributors; but our response times
might be a little slower than normal. We'll publish our Q1 2023 roadmap
when we return in January - but we'll be largely picking up where this
year has left off - improving the testing story for Toga.

## Want to get involved?

Want to get involved? Here are some open issues that would be a great
place to get started with contributing to a BeeWare project. They're all
relatively minor changes, but would provide a big improvement to the
lives of BeeWare users:

1.  [Modify the handling of app signing
    options](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/865)
2.  [Filter out a message generated after Xcode
    updates](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/780)
3.  [Add the ability to refresh the support package in a
    project](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/856)
4.  [Provide protection against creating projects with "semi-reserved"
    names](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/853)
5.  [Add the ability to configure the ABIs built by an Android
    project](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/808)
6.  [Add support for the ANDROID\_HOME environment
    variable](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/463)
7.  [Purge cache folders when installing app code in
    Briefcase](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/986)

Pick one of these tickets, drop a comment on the ticket to let others
know you're looking at it, and try your hand at a PR! We have a [guide
on setting up a Briefcase development
environment](https://briefcase.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how-to/contribute-code.html);
but if you need any additional assistance or guidance, you can ask on
the ticket, or join us on the [BeeWare Discord server](/bee/chat/).
