title: BeeWare Project Awarded a PSF Education Grant

body:

The BeeWare Project wants to make it possible for all Python developers
to write native apps for desktop and mobile platforms. We have solid
support for most desktop operating systems and iOS, but we know our
Android support is lacking. The BeeWare core team knows what needs to be
done to address the problem - what we’ve been missing are time and
resources.

Thanks to the PSF Education Grants group, that’s no longer an issue.
We’ve been awarded a US$50,000 grant to bring BeeWare’s Android support
to a level comparable with our iOS support. We currently don’t have the
time to do the work ourselves, so we’re calling for contractors to help
us deliver this support.

This is a paid contract, which we anticipate lasting 3-6 months
(depending on the experience of the winning contractor). You don’t have
to be based in the US or Europe, either; the opportunity is open to
anyone who can meet the requirements of the contract.

Unfortunately, the task calls for some sophisticated skills, and we’re
not in a position to provide extensive mentoring. A successful bid is
likely to require some prior experience, and a history with the
technologies involved.

for the contract is available. To register your interest, please forward
your resume and cover email to <contracts@beeware.org>.

We look forward to being able to announce full Android support in the
near future!
