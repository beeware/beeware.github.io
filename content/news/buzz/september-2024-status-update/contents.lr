title: September 2024 Status Update

In September, BeeWare hit an important milestone for Android support,
made good progress on packaging for iOS, and landed some significant
changes to Toga.

## What we've done

- Android is [now officially a Tier 3 platform in
  CPython](https://peps.python.org/pep-0011/#tier-3)! Over the last
  month, we've resolved a number of bugs that were preventing us from
  deploying a reliable buildbot for Android (on both x86\_64 and ARM64);
  as a result, the CPython buildbot fleet now contains Android
  buildbots. The Android-related changes to documentation have also been
  merged; Python 3.13.0rc3 (due for release any day now) will
  incorporate all these changes.
- We completed the [updates to Mobile Forge to support the new official
  iOS wheel format](https://github.com/beeware/mobile-forge/pull/55),
  and published updated wheels in this format for the packages for which
  we have recipes. As part of these changes, we've also added CI checks
  to Mobile Forge.
- We've [submitted a patch to support iOS in
  pip](https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/12962). This patch also requires
  some patches to
  [packaging](https://github.com/pypa/packaging/pull/832) and
  [distlib](https://github.com/pypa/distlib/pull/231) that pip includes
  as vendored copies.
- We've [submitted a patch to
  crossenv](https://github.com/benfogle/crossenv/pull/117) that allows
  cross-compiling Python packages for iOS. There is some additional work
  required before this patch can land - crossenv's testing framework is
  currently broken, so it's not currently possible to verify changes
  in CI. We'll be working on restoring this testing support in the very
  near future.
- We attended the CPython core team summit. During this week-long
  sprint, we were able to resolve a number of open questions about
  Python support on mobile, and begin planning for work that will
  hopefully be incorporated into the Python 3.14 release.
- We released [Toga 0.4.7](https://pypi.org/project/toga/0.4.7/),
  incorporating fixes for a number of bugs discovered in the recent
  0.4.6 release, as well as some minor feature additions.
- We transitioned Toga's GTK backend to use [PyGObject's native asyncio
  support](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2550). This allowed us
  to deprecate [Gbulb](https://github.com/beeware/gbulb), the GTK
  asyncio plugin that we've been maintaining for several years.
- We corrected an issue with the [use of recent Textual versions in
  Toga](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2822), and [added a
  bare-bones runtime test](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2823) to
  ensure that the problem doesn't re-occur. This also required a fix for
  [macOS console app testing in
  Briefcase](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1992).
- We made some [usability improvements to the rendering of Toga's
  documentation](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2831), and
  modified Toga's ReadTheDocs configuration to [encourage search engines
  to return the stable documentation by
  default](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2833).
- We modified the handling of Toga's app icons on macOS to [improve
  compatibility with
  PyInstaller](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2852).
- We corrected a number of issues with WebView handling, including
  [ensuring that DOM storage is always
  available](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2815), and [improving
  error handling when the WebView cannot be initialised on
  Windows](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2781).
- We added protection against an edge case of asynchronous Task handling
  that could lead to the [premature garbage collection of long lived
  tasks](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2814). We've also had some
  discussions with the CPython core team about [fixing this problem in
  Python itself](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/121264).
- We spoke at [PyBay](https://pybay.org) on building mobile apps in
  Python.

## What's next?

In October, we will continuing working on binary package support for
mobile platforms. In addition to responding to any review feedback on
the patches we've already submitted, we'll be working on new patches for
`cibuildwheel` and `meson-python`, as well as tooling to make it easy
for third-party libraries to run CPython test suites on mobile
platforms. We should also be able finalise Briefcase's Python 3.13
support for Android, and start work on Android packaging. Supporting
packaging for mobile platforms is a long term project which we expect to
continue for several months; the hope is that by the end of the year, we
will be able to contribute patches to third-party projects so that iOS
and Android wheels become officially produced, rather than
BeeWare-maintained artefacts.

## Want to get involved?

Want to get involved? Here are some open issues that would be a great
place to get started with contributing to a BeeWare project. They're all
relatively minor changes, but would provide a big improvement to the
lives of BeeWare users:

1.  [Update the Toga testbed test suite to use Pixel 7 Pro device
    sizes](https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/2251)
2.  [Filter out a message generated after Xcode
    updates](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/780)
3.  [Add the ability to configure the ABIs built by an Android
    project](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/808)
4.  [Rationalise the application of adhoc signing on
    macOS](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1099)
5.  [Add support for custom PyPI
    repositories](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1270)
6.  [Document how to debug an application in popular
    IDEs](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1393)
7.  [Add an option to select the Android base image when creating new
    emulators](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/737)
8.  [Add an API to entirely replace the style of a
    widget](https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/2305)
9.  [Correct the handling of quotation marks in Android
    apps](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1876)

know you're looking at it, and try your hand at a PR! We have a [guide
on setting up a Briefcase development
environment](https://briefcase.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how-to/contribute-code.html);
but if you need any additional assistance or guidance, you can ask on
the ticket, or join us on the [BeeWare Discord
