The year rolls on, and so does progress on BeeWare!

## What we've done

- We attended [EuroPython 2023](http://europython.eu), presenting on
  Briefcase, attending the WASM summit, and running a very successful 2
  day sprint.
- We've completed the audit of all Toga widgets on macOS, iOS and GTK!
  We've also completed the audit of
  [ScrollContainer](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1969) and
  [SplitContainer](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1984) on Windows
  and Android.
- We've added support for [Docker Desktop and rootless Docker on
  Linux](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1331).
- We've added the ability to get [detailed logs from the tools used by
  Briefcase to build
  apps](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1389).
- We've corrected some [warnings generated by pip when installing Python
  packages on Linux](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1375).
- We've added support for [generating APKs as an output format for
  Android](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1377).
- We've improved error reporting when [an application can't start on
  Android due to the device being too
  old](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1378), or [the Android
  device clock isn't in sync with the developer's
  laptop](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1356).
- We added `__repr__` and `__str__` implementations for Objective C
  structures like [NSRect, NSRange, NSPoint and
  more](https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/pull/340).
- We [formally dropped support for Python 3.7 in
  Toga](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2027).
- We improved error handling when [an app doesn't define a main window
  as part of it's startup](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2047).
- Type annotations in Toga [have been significantly
  improved](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2044). We've been
  adding type annotations as part of the widget audit, but some types
  (such as callbacks) weren't as specific as they could have been. We're
  now using Protocols to define some of the more complex types in Toga.
- We added an
  [ActivityIndicator](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2050) and
  [Divider](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2051) widget
  implementation in the Web backend.

## What's next?

The widget testing audit is now complete on macOS, iOS and GTK. An audit
of App and Window functionality is all that stands in the way of 100%
test coverage on those three platforms; it seems likely we'll get there
by the end of this month. Android and Windows coverage is close behind,
but might take a little longer.

Part of the reason for this delay is that we need to address an
important change in the most recent release of Android Studio. Over the
last few years, the Android ecosystem has been in the process of
migrating its build system from Groovy to Kotlin; Android Studio Giraffe
makes Kotlin the default for new projects, so we need to make sure we're
compatible with that change. The widget audit has also highlighted that
we need to improve our handling of subclass inheritance in Java; we're
hoping to make some changes that will enable us to fill in a few more
gaps in widget API coverage on Android.

We'll also be at [PyCon AU 2023](https://2023.pycon.org.au) from August
18-22. We're presenting on Saturday; and we'll be there for the full
duration of the sprints. See you in Tarntanya/Adelaide!

## Want to get involved?

Want to get involved? Here are some open issues that would be a great
place to get started with contributing to a BeeWare project. They're all
relatively minor changes, but would provide a big improvement to the
lives of BeeWare users:

1.  [Filter out a message generated after Xcode
    updates](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/780)
2.  [Add the ability to configure the ABIs built by an Android
    project](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/808)
3.  [Rationalise the application of adhoc signing on
    macOS](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1099)
4.  [Provide an option to override app settings from the command
    line](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1115)
5.  [Add support for custom PyPI
    repositories](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1270)
6.  [Document how to debug an application in popular
    IDEs](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1393)
7.  [Switch Toga's Winforms backend to use native Winforms
    imports](https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/1979)
8.  [Switch Toga's Android backend to use native Chaquopy
    syntax](https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/1980)

know you're looking at it, and try your hand at a PR! We have a [guide
on setting up a Briefcase development
environment](https://briefcase.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how-to/contribute-code.html);
but if you need any additional assistance or guidance, you can ask on
the ticket, or join us on the [BeeWare Discord
