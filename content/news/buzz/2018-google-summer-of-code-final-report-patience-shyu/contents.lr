Google Summer of Code is coming to an end. I've spent the summer working
on optimizing the [VOC compiler](/project/attic/voc/), and Iâ€™m super
excited to share the results.

## Results

There are a couple of ways to evaluate the performance improvement from
my project.

### Microbenchmarks

Firstly, we introduced a [microbenchmarking
suite](https://github.com/beeware/voc/blob/master/tests/microbenchmarks.py).
Each microbenchmark is a small piece of Python code that tests a single
and specific Python construct, or datatype, or control flow. The
benchmarking infrastructure itself is crude (essentially it just tells
you the total amount of processor time it took to run, with no fancy
statistics) but it has been extremely useful to me while working on
performance features to verify performance gain.

The idea is that the benchmarking suite is not to be run as part of the
full test suite, but rather as needed and manually whenever an
optimization is implemented. It also provides a way to check and prevent
performance regression, especially on the "optimized" parts of VOC.
While it doesn't really make sense to record specific numbers, as they
will always vary from machine to machine, it should be reasonably easy
to compare two versions of VOC. Benchmark numbers are included on each
optimization-related PR I've worked on this summer (see PR log below),
and I hope that more benchmarks will be added as more performance
efforts are carried out in the future.

### Pystone

[Pystone](https://github.com/beeware/voc/blob/master/tests/benchmarks/pystone.py)
is a Python [Dhrystone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhrystone), a
standard benchmark for testing the performance of Python on a machine.
Here are the before and after results on my machine:

May 10th, 2018:

```
$ python setup.py test -s tests.test\_pystone test\_pystone
(tests.test\_pystone.PystoneTest) ... Pystone(1.2) time for 50000
passes = 101.833 This machine benchmarks at 490.998 pystones/second

$ python setup.py test -s tests.test\_pystone test\_pystone
(tests.test\_pystone.PystoneTest) ... Pystone(1.2) time for 50000
passes = 101.298 This machine benchmarks at 493.595 pystones/second

$ python setup.py test -s tests.test\_pystone test\_pystone
(tests.test\_pystone.PystoneTest) ... Pystone(1.2) time for 50000
passes = 102.247 This machine benchmarks at 489.014 pystones/second
```

On current master (Aug 14th, 2018):

```
$ python setup.py test -s tests.test\_pystone test\_pystone
(tests.test\_pystone.PystoneTest) ... Pystone(1.2) time for 50000
passes = 11.2300 This machine benchmarks at 4452.37 pystones/second

$ python setup.py test -s tests.test\_pystone test\_pystone
(tests.test\_pystone.PystoneTest) ... Pystone(1.2) time for 50000
passes = 10.9833 This machine benchmarks at 4552.36 pystones/second

$ python setup.py test -s tests.test\_pystone pystone
(tests.test\_pystone.PystoneTest) ... Pystone(1.2) time for 50000
passes = 10.9498 This machine benchmarks at 4566.29 pystones/second
```

## Conclusions

Some things that I learned about VOC while working on this project:

1\. Object creation in the JVM is expensive. This definitely does not
mean that the VOC user writing Python should think about minimizing the
number of objects that she creates, but rather that any time we can
non-trivially reduce the number of objects created during bytecode
transpilation or in VOC-defined function calls, we can expect to see a
huge performance boost.
[Integer](https://github.com/beeware/voc/pull/825) and [boolean
preallocation](https://github.com/beeware/voc/pull/830), which is about
reusing objects that have already been created, was one of the most
significant improvements we made this summer.

2\. Method calls in VOC are expensive. This is essentially due to the
process of invoking a callable: you have to check that the method is
defined on the object, then construct it (read: object creation!), and
check the arguments, before it can actually be called. (This is done
using reflection, which is super interesting and confusing in itself.)
And this is the reason why [refactoring the Python comparison
functions](https://github.com/beeware/voc/pull/875) made such a big
performance impact, because we were able to circumvent this process.

3\. Exception-heavy code is expensive. Again, this is not to say that
the programmer is on the hook for being frugal when throwing exceptions,
but that VOC benefits greatly by avoiding the use of exceptions
internally except when strictly necessary. For instance, Python uses
StopIteration exceptions to signal the end of a for loop, and they
quickly rack up when you have nested loops (everything is ultimately
related to object creation!). That was the motivation for the [nested
loops optimization](https://github.com/beeware/voc/pull/881).

If I may be a bit more reflective here, one of the a-ha! moments I had
this summer was realizing that to really optimize something, you have to
understand where its biggest problems are first. I remember pitching to
Russ at the start of the summer things like loop unrolling, constant
folding, even converting to SSA-form (you know, stuff I heard about
optimization in my compilers class) and he was saying to me, think
simpler. While working on my project, I used a
[profiler](https://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jprofiler/overview.html)
to understand exactly which parts of VOC were slow, and that information
drove the changes we implemented. I think it worked out pretty well!

## Future Work

- Minimize boxing of primitive types like String and Int. As VOC is
  written half in Python, half in Java, a single integer can be found in
  various representations on its way through the compiler -- as a Python
  object, unboxed to a primitive Java int, then packaged back up to a
  Python object. This problem was (somewhat incoherently) addressed in
  my proposal, but ultimately we couldn't come up with a good
  abstraction to support it.
- Build a peephole optimizer. [CPython's peephole
  optimizer](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Python/peephole.c)
  scans generated bytecode to identify sequences of bytecode that can be
  optimized, VOC could benefit from this too.
- Hook up more benchmarks, which serve as both proof of the kinds of
  programs VOC can currently compile and areas ripe for performance
  improvement.

## Thank you

I will wrap this up by giving big thanks to
[Russ](https://github.com/freakboy3742), my mentor. The time you spent
helping me form my ideas, patiently answering my questions and reviewing
my work was invaluable to me. It couldn't have been easy keeping up with
what I was doing especially since I started improvising halfway through
the summer. I am so grateful for your help, thank you.
