title: November 2023 Status Update

body:

November has been a month of focus on the code that enables us to run
Python on iOS and Android - but there has still been some other high
profile developments in other parts of BeeWare.

## What we've done

- [PEP730](https://peps.python.org/pep-0730/), formalizing the
  introduction of iOS as a Tier 3 platform in CPython, has been
  [submitted to the Python Steering Council for
  ratification](https://github.com/python/steering-council/issues/218).
- One of the major topics covered by the [discussion about
  PEP730](https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-730-adding-ios-as-a-supported-platform/35854)
  was the use of a deprecated compiler argument. This led to some
  re-examination of how CPython could be delivered on iOS without using
  that argument. As a result of that discussion, modifications to [use
  CPython as a dynamically loaded
  framework](https://github.com/beeware/Python-Apple-support/pull/191)
  have been prepared. Although the original focus of this work was iOS,
  the same change will be also used for macOS - which means BeeWare no
  longer needs to compile a macOS support package (although we will
  still be lightly re-packaging the official CPython installer).
- We modified Toga's Image APIs so that [Pillow images can be used as
  source data](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2231).
- We [switched CI testing of Android apps to use a Linux
  machine](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2230). This wasn't
  previously possible, because Github didn't expose the necessary
  permissions in their Linux images; however, now that *is* possible,
  our Android tests run up to 5 times faster, and are less likely to be
  held up in CI because of availability of macOS testing machines.
- We corrected an issue on macOS where an OS-level setting controlling
  the use of tabs could [cause test failures in the Toga test
  suite](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2218).
- There have been some extended discussions and draft PRs related to
  Toga's [Application base
  class](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2244), and the addition of
  support for [status icons](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2238).
  These PRs are still in active development, but they will open up some
  interesting possibilities for Toga apps when they are completed.
- [Briefcase](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1550),
  [Toga](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2229) and [Rubicon
  ObjC](https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/pull/387) were all
  modified to use PEP621 metadata, removing the need for `setup.cfg`,
  `setup.py`, and `MANIFEST.in` files. As part of this change, we wrote
  a new [setuptools
  plugin](https://github.com/beeware/setuptools_dynamic_dependencies) to
  allow for dependencies to be dynamically defined.
- We modified Briefcase so that [answers to the new project
  wizard](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1552) and [values
  for configuration settings when running
  commands](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1542) can be
  overridden at the command line. This is mostly useful for testing
  purposes - it's now possible to generate a project and build it
  against a local template or support package build without needing to
  modify a `pyproject.toml` file or override input handling.
- We refactored the new project wizard so that [support for GUI toolkits
  is generated by an extensible
  plugin](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1524). Although we
  still ship with support for Toga, PySide, Pygame and PPB, this support
  is provided through a public interface, allowing other GUI toolkits to
  provide Briefcase with toolkit-specific modifications to the new
  project.
- We switched the default Android skin used by Briefcase from the [Pixel
  3a device skin to the Pixel 7
  skin](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1554). This is an
  entirely cosmetic change, but it does mean that screenshots will use a
  device that looks a little more modern.
- We've made significant progress on the [modifications to Chaquopy to
  support CPython 3.12](https://github.com/chaquo/chaquopy/milestone/3).
  This support will hopefully be released at the same time as the
  upcoming Android Studio "Hedgehog" release.
- We've made significant progress on running CPython's unit test suite
  on iOS in a CI configuration.

## What's next?

We won't see as much progress as normal in December as a result of the
end-of-year holidays. However, before we sign off for the year, we're
hoping to start looking at OptionContainer on mobile platforms, and
possibly start looking at Camera API support.

## Want to get involved?

Want to get involved? Here are some open issues that would be a great
place to get started with contributing to a BeeWare project. They're all
relatively minor changes, but would provide a big improvement to the
lives of BeeWare users:

1.  [Update the Toga testbed test suite to use Pixel 7 Pro device
    sizes](https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/2251)
2.  [Filter out a message generated after Xcode
    updates](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/780)
3.  [Add the ability to configure the ABIs built by an Android
    project](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/808)
4.  [Rationalise the application of adhoc signing on
    macOS](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1099)
5.  [Add support for custom PyPI
    repositories](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1270)
6.  [Document how to debug an application in popular
    IDEs](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1393)
7.  [Correctly handle incomplete project
    deletions](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/394)
8.  [Add an option to select the Android base image when creating new
    emulators](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/737)
9.  [Print notarisation log failures when building macOS
    apps](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1472)

Pick one of these tickets, drop a comment on the ticket to let others
know you're looking at it, and try your hand at a PR! We have a [guide
on setting up a Briefcase development
environment](https://briefcase.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how-to/contribute-code.html);
but if you need any additional assistance or guidance, you can ask on
the ticket, or join us on the [BeeWare Discord
server](https://beeware.org/bee/chat/).
