How time flies! Progress in October was a little slower than in past
months; preparing for and attending DjangoCon US, plus some well-earned
holiday leave reduced the amount of time we had to work on new features.
However, we were able to make a number of significant improvements.

## What we've done

During October:

- We restored the [web backend for
  Toga](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1475)! Web deployment has
  always been part of the BeeWare story, but we hit some technological
  challenges with the approach that we were taking in the Toga 0.2
  branch. However, with the addition of WASM as an officially supported
  platform in CPython 3.11, and the release of PyScript, we have a new
  way of getting Python in the browser. We have been able to use these
  tools to build a much improved Toga web backend.
- We added support for [deploying Briefcase apps as static web
  sites](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/898).
- We released official support for Python 3.11 on macOS, iOS and Linux -
  on the day that Python 3.11 was released!. Python 3.11 support for
  Android and Windows is ready to go, and should be published in a day
  or two.
- We modified Briefcase to [write its logs into
  subdirectory](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/911), instead
  of littering them in the project directory.
- We [presented a talk at DjangoCon US
  2022](https://2022.djangocon.us/talks/how-to-turn-your-website-into-an-app-and/).
  The video for this talk should be up in around a month. A major
  feature of this talk was a demo of an Electron-style "web site as an
  app", built entirely in Python. This demo (called Positron) has been
  [included in the Toga repository as an
  example](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1612).
- We attended the DjangoCon US 2022 sprints, and handed out 4 [challenge
  coins](https://beeware.org/contributing/challenge-coins/) to new
  contributors!
- We added the ability to [retrieve widgets by
  ID](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1599) to the Toga API.
- We made a big change to the way that [Toga backends are
  discovered](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1534). This new
  approach has two major advantages - firstly, it means third-parties
  can register their own backends; but more importantly, it means that
  code no longer needs to explicitly provide a backend. This simplifies
  the creation of test cases - but it also means that icons, images and
  fonts no longer need to be "late bound". This is an internal detail,
  but it significantly simplifies the code using those data types.
- We added the ability to [create Image objects from raw
  data](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1588), rather than an image
  file.
- We started the process of modernising the layout and tooling of the
  Toga repository. Some of these changes have already landed; more will
  come in the coming days. This ensures that we have a stable foundation
  for future work on Toga.

## What's next?

During November, we continuing to focus on Toga, with a particular focus
on testing. A particular focus will be working out how to test graphical
features of Toga - an area that has historically been managed entirely
with manual testing. Having strong automated testing of graphical
features will be a key milestone in ensuring Toga remains stable in the
long term.

## Want to get involved?

Want to get involved? Here's 8 open issues that would be a great place
to get started with contributing to a BeeWare project. They're all
relatively minor changes, but would provide a big improvement to the
lives of BeeWare users:

1.  [Improve protection against corrupted or incomplete
    downloads](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/753)
2.  [Modify the handling of app signing
    options](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/865)
3.  [Filter out a message generated after Xcode
    updates](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/780)
4.  [Add the ability to refresh the support package in a
    project](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/856)
5.  [Provide protection against creating projects with "semi-reserved"
    names](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/853)
6.  [Add the ability to configure the ABIs built by an Android
    project](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/808)
7.  [Add support for the ANDROID\_HOME environment
    variable](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/463)
8.  [Silence an warning that is displayed when an Android emulator has
    no skin defined](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/882)

Pick one of these tickets, drop a comment on the ticket to let others
know you're looking at it, and try your hand at a PR! We have a [guide
on setting up a Briefcase development
environment](https://briefcase.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how-to/contribute-code.html);
but if you need any additional assistance or guidance, you can ask on
the ticket, or join us on the [BeeWare Discord server](/bee/chat/).
