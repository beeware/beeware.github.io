title: 2024Q3 Roadmap

body:

We're halfway through the year, and BeeWare has seen another quarter of
significant progress. As always, this roadmap should be read as a guide
to what we aim to focus on over the coming quarter, rather than a hard
commitment of features that will be made available on a specific
deadline.

## Q2 progress

The biggest news for the quarter is that iOS is now officially a Tier 3
supported platform in CPython. All the patches required for iOS
compatibility have been landed, and a buildbot is in place; as of
3.13.0b1, CPython will build for iOS without any patching. Android
support is close behind; the only missing piece is the buildbot.

We made some major improvements to the BeeWare tutorial, adding sections
on customization of the packaged app, and handling permissions for apps.
We were able to use these changes as part of a well-received tutorial at
PyCon US. We also ran a very successful booth and sprint at PyCon US.

We also completed a lot of improvements in Briefcase and Toga, expanding
the types of apps that can be supported. Briefcase can now package
console apps; and Toga now has an official API for apps that don't have
menu bars, background apps, and apps that aren't governed by the
lifecycle of a single "main" window. These have been the subject of
long-standing feature requests (some of them almost as old as Toga
itself), so it's great to be able to finally address these limitations.

The one area where we weren't able to make an progress was in packaging
for mobile platforms. However, we did have some very productive
discussions at PyCon US, so we're confident we'll be able to make good
progress on this in the coming quarter.

## Q3 priorities

The highest priority for Q3 is to get ready for the Python 3.13 release
in early October. This involves finalising the work on the Android
buildbot so that Android is officially Tier 3; preparing Briefcase and
the Python builds that BeeWare supports to be ready for the 3.13
release; and doing as much work as we can on the packaging ecosystem so
that package maintainers can publish wheels for iOS and Android.

We'll also be attending [Kiwi PyCon](https://kiwipycon.nz) in August,
and attending the Python Core Team summit in September.

## Longer term goals

Getting the Python ecosystem to support iOS and Android is requires a
lot more than just adding patches to CPython and some related tools.
There will be a lot of education and support work required to help the
community adopt iOS and Android; and there is certain to be ongoing
maintenance as Python and the platforms evolve. There are also many ways
that Python mobile support could be made even better, including the
publication of official iOS and Android binaries, and potentially
getting to Tier 2 (or even Tier 1) support.

There's also a lot of work that can be done to Toga to make iOS and
Android compelling platforms to develop for. Toga is still missing some
key widgets to support navigation and data organization; and even when
these widgets exist, there will be a need for documentation and examples
to demonstrate how to build apps for these platforms. We anticipate
we'll be looking at these towards the end of the year. We also
anticipate that we'll start looking more seriously at Toga's web
backend, attempting to bring it to a level of support comparable to the
desktop and mobile platforms.

## Summary

It's been another busy quarter with a lot of progress, but as always,
there's still plenty to do. Completing official support for iOS and
Android means the foundational work needed to support mobile platforms
will be complete; we can then focus on what we - and the community -
build on that foundation.
