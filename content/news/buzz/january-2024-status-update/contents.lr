title: January 2024 Status Update

January has seen some long awaited and high profile features added to
BeeWare.

## What we've done

- [PEP 738](https://peps.python.org/pep-0738/), formalizing the
  introduction of Android as a Tier 3 platform in CPython, has been
  formally accepted as a draft. We're now revising the draft following
  community feedback, in anticipation of submitting the PEP for formal
  approval in the near future.
- We added a cross-platform Camera API to Toga. This API has been
  [implemented for iOS and
  macOS](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2266); the [implementation
  for Android](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2353) is in final
  review.
- We added an [OptionContainer widget for
  Android](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2350). This now means
  that OptionContainer is available on every desktop and mobile
  platform.
- We added the ability to [define a button with an
  Icon](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2310). In addition, we've
  added some [major clarifications to the documentation about the
  difference between an Icon and an
  Image](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2348).
- We [reworked the way that widget IDs are
  handled](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2320). This change was
  required due to a bug caused by the interaction of Python's garbage
  collector and the widget registry that prevented the re-use of widget
  IDs in some situations. The new implementation means that the widget
  registry behaves a lot more like a browser's DOM - a widget can only
  be discovered by ID when it is actually part of a widget layout.
- We added Briefcase support for [Python 3.12 on
  Android](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1596).
- We added a mechanism for [defining app
  permissions](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1599) in your
  Briefcase project.
- We added the ability for Android projects to [declare the native
  Android libraries that they depend
  on](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1610).
- We've been polishing the CPython patches necessary to support iOS and
  Android, in anticipation of submitting these patches upstream. To
  follow progress on this work, subscribe to the CPython tickets for
  [iOS support](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/114099) and
  [Android support](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/71052).

## What's next?

In February, we'll be focusing on the iOS and Android patches to
CPython, and the finalisation of [PEP
738](https://peps.python.org/pep-0738/). While we're waiting for CPython
patches to be reviewed, we'll be looking into geolocation and mapping
functionality.

## Want to get involved?

Want to get involved? Here are some open issues that would be a great
place to get started with contributing to a BeeWare project. They're all
relatively minor changes, but would provide a big improvement to the
lives of BeeWare users:

1.  [Update the Toga testbed test suite to use Pixel 7 Pro device
    sizes](https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/2251)
2.  [Filter out a message generated after Xcode
    updates](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/780)
3.  [Add the ability to configure the ABIs built by an Android
    project](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/808)
4.  [Rationalise the application of adhoc signing on
    macOS](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1099)
5.  [Add support for custom PyPI
    repositories](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1270)
6.  [Document how to debug an application in popular
    IDEs](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1393)
7.  [Correctly handle incomplete project
    deletions](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/394)
8.  [Add an option to select the Android base image when creating new
    emulators](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/737)
9.  [Print notarisation log failures when building macOS
    apps](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1472)
10. [Add an API to replace a child of a
    widget](https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/2301)
11. [Add an API to entirely replace the style of a
    widget](https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/2305)
12. [Add the ability to define content when creating a
    window](https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/2307)

know you're looking at it, and try your hand at a PR! We have a [guide
on setting up a Briefcase development
environment](https://briefcase.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how-to/contribute-code.html);
but if you need any additional assistance or guidance, you can ask on
the ticket, or join us on the [BeeWare Discord
server](https://beeware.org/bee/chat/).
