The biggest challenge for any Open Source project is finding the
resources needed to support development - and the BeeWare project is no
exception.

To date, BeeWare has been primarily driven by the efforts of volunteers.
We've been able to achieve amazing things with those volunteer efforts,
demonstrating that Python is a viable language for GUI development on
macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS and Android, as well as providing a
proof-of-concept demonstration on Web. However, there are still lots of
features that we'd like to add, and lots of ongoing maintenance that
needs to be done as operating systems and hardware platforms evolve.

Over the years, we've been incredibly fortunate to have the financial
support of our members. While I'm incredibly grateful for that support,
it falls a long way short of even one full-time salary. We've also
received grants (such as the PSF grant), and short-term contracts. These
grants and contracts have enabled us to add specific (and much needed)
features to BeeWare - but they don't provide resources for ongoing
development and maintenance.

However, the brutal truth is that our rate of progress is severely
limited by the volunteered resources at our disposal. As a result, I've
spent a lot of time over the last few years thinking about how we can
fund the work that needs to be done to make BeeWare the go-to solution
for GUI development on desktop, mobile, and more - and do so without
compromising the Open Source roots of the project.

I'm incredibly excited to announce that I've found a solution.

On March 21, I joined Anaconda as a Principal Engineer and Team Lead -
and the team I will be leading will be focused 100% on BeeWare.

Anaconda is no stranger to Open Source. In addition to indirectly
funding a number of community efforts through their Anaconda Dividend
program, they directly employ people to work on Numba, Dask, Pyston and
more. BeeWare will be joining this stable of projects.

Anaconda is supporting BeeWare in this way because they see the
potential for Python as a language for GUI development - especially on
mobile platforms. Python has established itself as an incredibly popular
language in education, science, business and more - and in all those
markets, there is potential to develop apps. By adding mobile platform
support and app development to the list of tasks to which Python is
already incredibly capable, Anaconda hopes to ensure the long term
prospects of Python as a language, as well as ensuring a healthy market
for the products they sell commercially.

BeeWare will continue to be a 100% Open Source project, with all
contributions welcome from the community. The only difference is that
Anaconda will be directly employing some of the contributors to the
project. The conversations I've had with Anaconda's engineering
leadership indicates they are acutely aware of the tension that exists
between corporate funding and the technical direction of an Open Source
project. They've indicated that they want to ensure that BeeWare's
technical direction remains independent in both appearance and
substance. This includes financial independence - the financial support
provided by our members will remain vitally important, as it provides
project-level funding for resources such as hosting and promotional
materials.

The related good news is that part of my job title is "Team Lead" - so
in the very near future, we'll be looking for people to join me on my
team. I'm already working out the details of the team that I'd like to
have, so watch this space for hiring announcements.

Anaconda has a long history of understanding and contributing to both
the Python ecosystem and the Open Source community. Adding BeeWare to
their stable of supported projects has enormous potential for BeeWare,
and the Python ecosystem as a whole. I'm incredibly excited for what the
future holds.
