title: May 2023 Status Update

May has been another month of steady progress - mostly on widget testing, but also in some other key areas of the project.

What we've done
----------------

* We've completed the audit of the `TextInput, PasswordInput, <https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1944>`__ and `MultilineTextInput <https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1938>`__ widgets; we've completed the audit of `NumberInput <https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1946>`__, `WebView <https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1949>`__, `DateInput, TimeInput <https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1951>`__, and `Selection <https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1955>`__ on macOS, iOS and GTK; and we've begun the audit of `ImageView <https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1956>`__. 
* We've added documentation and tests for the input validation API as part of the TextInput audit.
* We've added documentation and tests for ListSource as part of the Selection audit, and modified the implementation of Selection to use a ListSource.
* We `refactored the implementation of Dialog <https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1948>`__ so that it is architecturally consistent with the rest of Toga; this will hopefully also lead to an easier testing story.
* We made `significant progress in supporting custom fonts on GTK  <https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1903>`__, including adding a GUI test of this capability.
* We `completed a refactor of Briefcase's tool integrations <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1093>`__. This introduces a consistent API for all tools that Briefcase uses, as well as introducing type annotations for a lot more of the codebase.
* We've introduced `conditional coverage to the Briefcase codebase <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1262>`__. This means developers who only have access to a single testing platform can get a 100% coverage report on their work before submitting to CI for cross-platform confirmation.
* We've helped triage a number of bugs in the Python 3.12.0b1 release (revealed by our testing for `Briefcase <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1290>`__ and `Rubicon-ObjC <https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/issues/313>`__).
* We've modified Briefcase's Flatpak backend to `require an explicit runtime <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1272>`__, rather than falling back to a default runtime that is no longer supported.
* We developed a `draft implementation of a Briefcase test runner for the Web backend <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1285>`__. This is an important first step to being able to unit test Toga's Web backend; however, there's still a couple of technical challenges outstanding before we can complete that work.
* We've begun the process of `upgrading Briefcase's Java support from Java 8 to Java 17 <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1271>`__.

What's next?
--------------

June will be another month with a focus on GUI test coverage. We're still hoping that this work will be complete by the end of June - we're averaging 1-2 widgets a week, and we have 8 widgets remaining; however, every widget is throwing up unique challenges (and revealing deep bugs - sometimes in the underlying GUI frameworks), so it's possible the audit work may need to continue into July.

Want to get involved?
-----------------------

Want to get involved? Here are some open issues that would be a great place to get started with contributing to a BeeWare project. They're all relatively minor changes, but would provide a big improvement to the lives of BeeWare users:

1. `Filter out a message generated after Xcode updates <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/780>`__
2. `Add the ability to configure the ABIs built by an Android project <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/808>`__
3. `Add support for the ANDROID_HOME environment variable <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/463>`__
4. `Rationalise the application of adhoc signing on macOS <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1099>`__
5. `Detect a failure when trying to install on an Android device that is too old <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1157>`__
6. `Use the on-device clock to filter Android device logs <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1146>`__
7. `Add an APK packaging target for Android <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1136>`__
8. `Provide an option to override app settings from the command line <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1115>`__
