title: May 2023 Status Update

body:

May has been another month of steady progress - mostly on widget
testing, but also in some other key areas of the project.

## What we've done

- We've completed the audit of the [TextInput,
  PasswordInput,](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1944) and
  [MultilineTextInput](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1938)
  widgets; we've completed the audit of
  [NumberInput](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1946),
  [WebView](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1949), [DateInput,
  TimeInput](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1951), and
  [Selection](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1955) on macOS, iOS
  and GTK; and we've begun the audit of
  [ImageView](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1956).
- We've added documentation and tests for the input validation API as
  part of the TextInput audit.
- We've added documentation and tests for ListSource as part of the
  Selection audit, and modified the implementation of Selection to use a
  ListSource.
- We [refactored the implementation of
  Dialog](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1948) so that it is
  architecturally consistent with the rest of Toga; this will hopefully
  also lead to an easier testing story.
- We made [significant progress in supporting custom fonts on
  GTK](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1903), including adding a
  GUI test of this capability.
- We [completed a refactor of Briefcase's tool
  integrations](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1093). This
  introduces a consistent API for all tools that Briefcase uses, as well
  as introducing type annotations for a lot more of the codebase.
- We've introduced [conditional coverage to the Briefcase
  codebase](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1262). This means
  developers who only have access to a single testing platform can get a
  100% coverage report on their work before submitting to CI for
  cross-platform confirmation.
- We've helped triage a number of bugs in the Python 3.12.0b1 release
  (revealed by our testing for
  [Briefcase](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1290) and
  [Rubicon-ObjC](https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/issues/313)).
- We've modified Briefcase's Flatpak backend to [require an explicit
  runtime](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1272), rather than
  falling back to a default runtime that is no longer supported.
- We developed a [draft implementation of a Briefcase test runner for
  the Web backend](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1285). This
  is an important first step to being able to unit test Toga's Web
  backend; however, there's still a couple of technical challenges
  outstanding before we can complete that work.
- We've begun the process of [upgrading Briefcase's Java support from
  Java 8 to Java 17](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1271).

## What's next?

June will be another month with a focus on GUI test coverage. We're
still hoping that this work will be complete by the end of June - we're
averaging 1-2 widgets a week, and we have 8 widgets remaining; however,
every widget is throwing up unique challenges (and revealing deep bugs -
sometimes in the underlying GUI frameworks), so it's possible the audit
work may need to continue into July.

## Want to get involved?

Want to get involved? Here are some open issues that would be a great
place to get started with contributing to a BeeWare project. They're all
relatively minor changes, but would provide a big improvement to the
lives of BeeWare users:

1.  [Filter out a message generated after Xcode
    updates](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/780)
2.  [Add the ability to configure the ABIs built by an Android
    project](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/808)
3.  [Add support for the ANDROID\_HOME environment
    variable](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/463)
4.  [Rationalise the application of adhoc signing on
    macOS](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1099)
5.  [Detect a failure when trying to install on an Android device that
    is too old](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1157)
6.  [Use the on-device clock to filter Android device
    logs](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1146)
7.  [Add an APK packaging target for
    Android](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1136)
8.  [Provide an option to override app settings from the command
    line](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1115)
