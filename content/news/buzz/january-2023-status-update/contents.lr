BeeWare has had an exciting start to the new year, with a couple of significant releases

What we've done
----------------

We had two big releases in January.

Firstly, we released Briefcase 0.3.12. This is the first Briefcase release in 3 months, so it includes a lot of improvements, but the most notable improvements are the new "Testing mode", a major improvement to the Android build process, and a huge number of bug fixes and improvements - especially on Windows. 

Secondly - and more importantly - we released Toga 0.3.0! No more dev releases or ``--pre`` flags for ``pip`` - the stable release of Toga on PyPI is now closely tracking actual development. It's been over 5 years since we last released an official stable Toga version, even though we've been recommending the dev releases for most of that time. However, as a result of a number of changes that landed this month, we're finally committing to the 0.3.0 branch properly.

These releases incorporate changes going back months (and years); but we made some very specific progress during January:

* Chaquopy `had a new release. <https://chaquo.com/chaquopy/chaquopy-version-14-0-2/>`__, significantly improving build times on Android, improving the rendering of ``stdout`` content in the Android logs, adding some features that make it easier to expose the original project source code in the running app bundle, and enabling PEP517 builds of project dependencies.
* Briefcase is a now able to `reference local source packages when building Linux AppImage binaries <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1058>`__.
* Some errors caused by the way the Windows Store version of Python handles local application data `have been corrected <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1054>`__.
* Briefcase's help text now `shows the list of platforms and output formats <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1005>`__, rather than requiring an additional help call to retrieve that information.
* Some issues with thread and asyncio safety in Rubicon ObjC were `identified and resolved <https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/pull/246>`__, along with an issue associated with the way some Objective C classes (such as NSWindow) are `renamed at runtime <https://github.com/beeware/rubicon-objc/pull/258>`__.
* Initial GUI testing backends for `macOS <https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1707>`__, `iOS <https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1749>`__ and `GTK <https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1755>`__ were added.
* A long standing issue with the `replacement of root window content <https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/1439>`__ on GTK and iOS has been resolved.
* Coverage testing was `added to the Toga Android GUI test backend <https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1747>`__.
* An API was added to `allow scrolling MultilineTextInput widgets <https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1728>`__ to the top and bottom of the widget content.
* The work `moving Toga to use Setuptools-SCM <https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1675>`__ was completed. Development versions of Toga will now report a specific version control commit; release versions have their version determined by the git tag used to produce the release.
* We completed a major review of the way we're using Github tags, and modified those tags to be consistent across all repositories.

What's next?
--------------

The last 3 months have been spent trying to get a GUI testing framework in place for Toga. That work is now in place, so now we'll be working full time on writing GUI tests for Toga, with the aim of getting Toga to 100% coverage. Along the way, we'll discover all the edge cases, bugs, and partially missing implementations that are lurking in the individual Toga widgets.
