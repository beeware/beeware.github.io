title: March 2023 Status Update

March has been a month of slow but steady progress for BeeWare.

## What we've done

- Progress on GUI testing in Toga is continuing. We now have 7 widgets
  fully tested, with another 2 in progress. As with last month's update,
  getting these tests passing has required wrestling a lot of
  fundamentals, in particular around the simulation of events such as
  mouse clicks. We're also discovering (and fixing) lots of corner cases
  in widget implementations that only surface when you're doing rigorous
  and repeatable testing.
- We've made some [major changes to the way GTK widgets are
  rendered](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1794). This change
  significantly reduces the amount of re-rendering that is performed by
  GTK, as well as resolving a number of long standing issues related to
  resizing widgets.
- Thanks to some community contributions, we were were able to add
  support for [focus events and text
  alignment](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1817) on GTK's
  TextInput widget, and support for [text alignment and
  fonts](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1821) on GTK's NumberInput
  widget.
- We landed the implementation of a [Linux system package
  backend](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1106) for
  Briefcase, which can output DEB and RPM packages. Thanks to a
  community contribution, we were also able to add support for [Arch
  packages](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1143)
- We modified the [locations where Briefcase outputs build
  artefacts](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1107). This
  removes some sources of bugs associated with tools not supporting
  spaces in filenames, and makes Briefcase's output consistent with
  other tools in the Python ecosystem.
- We made significant progress on [modifying Briefcase's AppImage and
  Flatpak backends](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1132) to
  use Indygreg's [Standalone
  Python](https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone), rather
  than BeeWare's Linux support package. Standalone Python is becoming a
  de facto standard for pre-compiled Python builds (especially on
  Linux), so it makes sense for BeeWare to converge on this common
  standard. This change will also significantly speed up Flatpak builds,
  should be more stable on AppImage, allows us to switch to
  [manylinux](http://github.com/pypa/manylinux) base images - and it
  reduces the number of projects that BeeWare is responsible for
  maintaining. We're currently waiting on a [fix to the linuxdeploy GTK
  plugin](https://github.com/linuxdeploy/linuxdeploy-plugin-gtk/pull/45)
  to be merged before we can land this change.
- Thanks to a community contribution, we added support for
  [PyGame](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1125) to Briefcase.
- We migrated BeeWare's CI to [use the new System packaging
  backend](https://github.com/beeware/.github/pull/14) on Linux. This
  means that CI is significantly faster, as building system packages
  requires a lot less processing than an AppImage.
- We [released Travertino 0.2.0](https://pypi.org/project/travertino/).
  Travertino is the library that underpins Toga's Pack layout algorithm.
  It's been several years since we last did a Travertino release, but
  some recent bug fixes warranted an update.
- We presented a tutorial at [Everything Open
  2023](https://2023.everythingopen.au).

We also made a big change to our social media strategy: we started a
Mastodon account. We've wound down our Twitter usage at the end of last
year; going forward, you can get your bite size BeeWare updates from
[@beeware@fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/@beeware).

## What's next?

In terms of technical goals, April will continue our push for GUI test
coverage. However, we're expecting progress to be a little slower,
because of one big event - [PyCon US](https://pycon.us/2023). We'll have
a booth in the community section of the conference floor; the core team
are presenting 2 talks; we're presenting at the Language Summit; and
we'll be at the sprints for the first 3 days. Preparing for these talks
will take up a lot of our time in April, as will the event itself - so
progress is likely to be a little slower than normal. If you're going to
be there, come by the booth and say hi! If you'd like to help us to
staff the booth - get in touch [on
Discord](https://beeware.org/bee/chat/), [on
Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@beeware), [or
email](mailto:contact@beeware.org)!

## Want to get involved?

Want to get involved? Here are some open issues that would be a great
place to get started with contributing to a BeeWare project. They're all
relatively minor changes, but would provide a big improvement to the
lives of BeeWare users:

1.  [Modify the handling of app signing
    options](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/865)
2.  [Filter out a message generated after Xcode
    updates](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/780)
3.  [Add the ability to refresh the support package in a
    project](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/856)
4.  [Provide protection against creating projects with "semi-reserved"
    names](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/853)
5.  [Add the ability to configure the ABIs built by an Android
    project](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/808)
6.  [Add support for the ANDROID\_HOME environment
    variable](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/463)
7.  [Improve validation of project names in the Briefcase
    wizard](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1011)
8.  [Rationalise the application of adhoc signing on
    macOS](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1099)
9.  [Correct the capture of log messages on the web
    backend](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1090)

Pick one of these tickets, drop a comment on the ticket to let others
know you're looking at it, and try your hand at a PR! We have a [guide
on setting up a Briefcase development
environment](https://briefcase.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how-to/contribute-code.html);
but if you need any additional assistance or guidance, you can ask on
the ticket, or join us on the [BeeWare Discord
server](https://beeware.org/bee/chat/).
