In October, BeeWare saw some important releases, plus more good progress
on binary packaging for iOS.

## What we've done

- Most importantly, we released [Briefcase
  0.3.20](https://pypi.org/project/briefcase/0.3.20/) and [Toga
  0.4.8](https://pypi.org/project/toga/0.4.8/), including support for
  Python 3.13 - which includes the official support in Python for iOS
  and Android! This is a major milestone for BeeWare as a project,
  representing a significant portion of the work done over the last 12
  months.
- We've prepared an [initial patch to cibuildwheel that is able to build
  and test simple iOS
  wheels](https://github.com/freakboy3742/cibuildwheel/tree/ios-support).
  This patch isn't ready to submit upstream, but it is able to build
  simple iOS wheels.
- We've submitted a patch to Pillow to [isolate its build system from
  Homebrew when building on
  macOS](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/pull/8497). This is
  essential for iOS support, as it's easy for Homebrew macOS ARM64
  binaries to leak into iOS builds; but it also has benefits for macOS
  builds.
- We've made [a number of improvements to
  multibuild](https://github.com/multi-build/multibuild), the tooling
  that Pillow uses to compile non-Python binary dependencies.
- We've [modified the CPython iOS testbed
  project](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/126169) so that it can
  be used as a testbed for *any* iOS Python project.
- We've [improved error reporting when Briefcase can't clone a
  template](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2033).
- We've switched to using `httpx` instead of `requests` for [Briefcase's
  internal download
  handling](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/2041). This
  provides slightly better error handling, better options for improving
  HTTP/2 usage, and we're now consistently using `httpx` in Briefcase
  and in our example code.
- We've modified Toga to [lazily load
  components](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2686), rather than
  importing everything into the `toga` namespace at startup. This should
  improve application startup times, especially on platforms like mobile
  and web where this startup time is noticeable.
- We resolved an issue causing [intermittent test failures when testing
  Toga on Wayland](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2893).

## What's next?

We will be continuing to work on binary packaging in November. We're
using Pillow as a demonstrator for this work - it's a package that has a
significant binary component, is widely used (including on mobile), but
has a non-trivial build process (largely due to the non-Python binary
dependencies). The hope is that by the time we're able to compile Pillow
for iOS, we will have resolved many of the issues facing other binary
packages. Our goal remains to have at least *some* third-party projects
officially supporting iOS and Android by the end of the year, but this
may be impeded by the sequence of dependencies that need to land and be
published before upstream projects can accept iOS and Android patches.

We'll also be speaking at [PyCon AU](https://2024.pycon.org.au) at the
end of the month, including attending both days of the sprints. If
you're able to make it to Narrm/Melbourne, we hope we'll see you there!

## Want to get involved?

Want to get involved? Here are some open issues that would be a great
place to get started with contributing to a BeeWare project. They're all
relatively minor changes, but would provide a big improvement to the
lives of BeeWare users:

1.  [Update the Toga testbed test suite to use Pixel 7 Pro device
    sizes](https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/2251)
2.  [Filter out a message generated after Xcode
    updates](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/780)
3.  [Add the ability to configure the ABIs built by an Android
    project](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/808)
4.  [Rationalise the application of adhoc signing on
    macOS](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1099)
5.  [Add support for custom PyPI
    repositories](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1270)
6.  [Document how to debug an application in popular
    IDEs](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1393)
7.  [Add an option to select the Android base image when creating new
    emulators](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/737)
8.  [Add an API to entirely replace the style of a
    widget](https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/2305)
9.  [Correct the handling of quotation marks in Android
    apps](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1876)
