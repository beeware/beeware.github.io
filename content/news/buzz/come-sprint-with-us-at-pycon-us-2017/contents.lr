-------

`PyCon US 2017 <https://us.pycon.org/2017/>`__ is running in Portland,
Oregon from May 17 - 25, and it's bound to be another amazing
conference.

For the second year in a row, the `BeeWare team <https://pybee.org>`__
will be on site with a `booth in the Exhibit
Hall <https://twitter.com/PyBeeWare/status/737043373953978368>`__, along
with other Open Source projects from the Python world.

With this booth, we get two tickets to the conference. This includes:

-  access to the opening reception
-  3 days of conference talks, expo hall / job fair
-  breakfasts, breaks, lunches, and
-  swag bag

Thing is, both `Russell <https://twitter.com/freakboy3742>`__ and I have
already registered.

So, we want to give you the ticket.

Yes, **you.**

If you can get yourself to Portland on the conference days, we want to
give you our free ticket.

What do we want in return?

Just a little bit of your time.

The `Bee Team <https://pybee.org/community/team/>`__ will be helping to
staff our booth, but we'd also like to see (and give!) talks, so helping
us out by running the booth would be lovely. (Plus, and I'm sure Russell
would agree, just helping out on the booth earns you a
`coin <https://pybee.org/contributing/challenge-coins/>`__)

Plus, we'd love for you to stick around for the famous coding Sprints.
These are held in the four days after the event, while people are still
in town. We get coffee, lunch, and a room full of tables, chairs and
copious amount of power points, and we code on projects. We'll be
running a `BeeWare
sprint <https://twitter.com/PyBeeWare/status/738400648614449152>`__
where we will be mentoring and helping first time contributors earn
their shiny `challenge
coin <https://twitter.com/PyBeeWare/status/738425474754314240>`__

Does this sound like something you'd be interested in?

Please, `email us! <mailto:contact@pybee.org>`__

Tell us about yourself! Who you are, what you do, why you want to go to
PyCon and what makes you interested in Python.

We need to allocate our tickets early, so please email us **by February
12, 2017**

If you have any questions, just ask
`myself <https://twitter.com/glasnt>`__ or
`Russell <https://twitter.com/freakboy3742>`__!

We'd love to see you there! ✨
