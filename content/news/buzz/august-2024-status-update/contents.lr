title: August 2024 Status Update

August has seen some good progress on BeeWare's support for Python 3.13,
plus a number of long-awaited features landing in a stable release of
Toga.

## What we've done

- We've completed the process of backporting the CPython changes for iOS
  compatibility to Python 3.9 through 3.12. We've published support
  packages and stub binaries that incorporate these changes, and made
  the [changes to Briefcase needed to support these new
  versions](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1934).
- We've begun work on updating Mobile Forge and related binary tooling
  to support the new official binary tag and framework format required
  by the PEP-compliant patch for iOS support. So far, we're able to
  compile simple binary packages like `lru-dict`, and non-Python
  dependencies like `libjpeg`; we're working on restoring binary support
  for more complex binary dependencies.
- We've landed the [Android test runner
  script](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/121595), fixed a number
  of issues that have arisen in CPython's Android support since the
  original patches landed, and [deployed an Android CPython
  buildbot](https://buildbot.python.org/#/builders/1594). This buildbot
  has revealed some edge cases (primarily in socket and signal handling)
  that only appear to manifest under the unusual load conditions
  generated by a buildbot; so, we've temporarily disabled the buildbot
  while we investigate the cause of these problems.
- We completed work on [a new API for document-based
  apps](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2666).
- We completed work on [an API for status icon
  apps](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2768).
- We released [Toga 0.4.6](https://pypi.org/project/toga/0.4.6/). This
  includes the support for document-based apps, status icon apps, and a
  number of other long-awaited features, such as apps without menubars,
  available in a stable release.
- We [updated the support for WebView on
  Windows](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2764) to a more recent
  version, and [resolved an issue with compatibility with Windows Store
  Python](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2778).
- We diagnosed and contributed fixes for a number of issues in tools
  that BeeWare depends on for our build tooling. This includes updates
  to CI configurations to support Sphinx 8, [fixes for Sphinx 8 support
  in a Sphinx
  plugin](https://github.com/crate/sphinx_csv_filter/pull/49), and
  [diagnosing issues with a recent Towncrier
  update](https://github.com/twisted/towncrier/issues/632).
- We presented a keynote at [Kiwi PyCon](https://kiwipycon.nz) on the
  future of Python.

## What's next?

In September, we'll be continuing work on binary package support for
mobile platforms. Once we've restored support for binary wheels using
the new binary tag and framework format, and added support for Python
3.13, we'll start upstreaming the changes we've made so that the wider
Python ecosystem can start supporting iOS and Android. We'll also start
working on the fixes to tools like `pip`, `cibuildwheel`, and
`meson-python` that need to have explicit iOS support. We expect that
this work will be ongoing for several months, but some of the work
should be submitted upstream for review by the end of the month.

We'll also be presenting at talk at [PyBay](https://pybay.org) in San
Francisco on mobile app development in Python, followed by the CPython
core team sprint.

## Want to get involved?

Want to get involved? Here are some open issues that would be a great
place to get started with contributing to a BeeWare project. They're all
relatively minor changes, but would provide a big improvement to the
lives of BeeWare users:

1.  [Update the Toga testbed test suite to use Pixel 7 Pro device
    sizes](https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/2251)
2.  [Filter out a message generated after Xcode
    updates](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/780)
3.  [Add the ability to configure the ABIs built by an Android
    project](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/808)
4.  [Rationalise the application of adhoc signing on
    macOS](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1099)
5.  [Add support for custom PyPI
    repositories](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1270)
6.  [Document how to debug an application in popular
    IDEs](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1393)
7.  [Add an option to select the Android base image when creating new
    emulators](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/737)
8.  [Add an API to entirely replace the style of a
    widget](https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/2305)
9.  [Correct the handling of quotation marks in Android
    apps](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1876)
