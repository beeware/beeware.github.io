In June, BeeWare made a lot of progress, landing lots of new features -
many of which have been the subject of requests and discussions for a
long time.

## What we've done

- We [added support for packaging console apps to
  Briefcase](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1781). This
  involved adding a new `.pkg` packaging type for macOS, as well as a
  number of other improvements to the stub app and MSI packaging on
  Windows. In addition to providing a way to package console apps on
  macOS, the addition of `.pkg` format means it is now possible to
  distribute apps using centralised device management tooling (such as
  Kandji or FleetDM).
- We modified Briefcase to [distribute the stub binaries as standalone
  artefacts, rather than including them in the app
  template](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1849). We also
  [significantly optimised how Briefcase uses
  templates](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1855). Between
  these two changes, the download size required for a first project on
  macOS has been reduced from around 200MB, to less than 4MB.
- We [isolated Briefcase's use of
  Cookiecutter](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1864) so that
  all of Briefcase's cached content is contained in Briefcase's own
  cache folder.
- We [added support for distribution certificates on
  macOS](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1856).
- We [modified Toga's APIs to use namedtuple types for Size and Position
  references](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2585).
- We corrected a number of stability issues with Toga's testbed CI, and
  [added CI testing for Wayland on
  Linux](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2670).
- We completed a [major overhaul of typing in Toga's API
  surface](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2252).
- We [added support for conditional coverage in Toga's
  testing](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2642). It is now
  possible to get a clean coverage report without running the test suite
  on every Python version and every platform.
- We [added an official API for customizing the system-installed menu
  items](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2636).
- We [added an API for detecting the screens available for an app to
  use, and for setting the position of windows relative to those
  screens](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1930).
- We [added support for "simple"
  apps](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2649) - apps that don't
  have menu bars.
- We [added support for apps whose lifecycle isn't tied to a single
  "Main" window](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2651), such as
  background apps (apps that don't have any windows) and document-based
  apps.
- We [added support for app modal
  dialogs](https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2669).

## What's next?

Work on Toga's App interface isn't quite finished - we're expecting to
finalise the Document API in the near future. Once that work is
complete, our focus will be the mobile Python binary packaging
ecosystem. The work we've done so far this year has led to CPython 3.13
formally supporting iOS and Android as Tier 3 supported platforms; the
next step is ensuring that the rest of the community can build iOS and
Android packages. This will involve improvements to tools like `pip`,
`cibuildwheel`, `meson-python` and more. We expect that this work will
take most of the rest of the quarter to release; but there should be
some initial signs of progress by the end of the month.

## Want to get involved?

Want to get involved? Here are some open issues that would be a great
place to get started with contributing to a BeeWare project. They're all
relatively minor changes, but would provide a big improvement to the
lives of BeeWare users:

1.  [Update the Toga testbed test suite to use Pixel 7 Pro device
    sizes](https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/2251)
2.  [Filter out a message generated after Xcode
    updates](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/780)
3.  [Add the ability to configure the ABIs built by an Android
    project](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/808)
4.  [Rationalise the application of adhoc signing on
    macOS](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1099)
5.  [Add support for custom PyPI
    repositories](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1270)
6.  [Document how to debug an application in popular
    IDEs](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1393)
7.  [Add an option to select the Android base image when creating new
    emulators](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/737)
8.  [Add an API to entirely replace the style of a
    widget](https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/2305)
9.  [Correct the handling of quotation marks in Android
    apps](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1876)
