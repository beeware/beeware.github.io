description:

We all know Python is a powerful, expressive and accessible programming
language. What you may *not* know is how much of the internals of Python
itself is exposed for you to use and manipulate, in the form of APIs
that are just as powerful, expressive and accessible as Python itself.

In this talk, you'll be introduced to the tools and libraries Python
provides to manipulate the compilation and execution of Python code. You
will also see how you can use those tools to target execution
environments other than the CPython virtual machine, and, specifically,
how the BeeWare project uses them in the VOC transpiler to run Python
code on the Java virtual machine.
