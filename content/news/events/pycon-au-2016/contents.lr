The PyCon Australia 2016 team is happy to announce that our first
keynote speaker will be Dr Russell Keith-Magee.

We’re familiar with Python as a scripting language, as a web server
language, as a data analysis language, and as a teaching language. But
is that the limit of where Python can be used? What is the future for
Python on other platforms? Is the prospect of using Python on those
platforms a novelty, or a viable way to fend off an existential threat
to the language? And how does this threat intersect with other threats
we have to our community, and to our industry?

Dr Russell Keith-Magee is a 10 year veteran of the Django core team, and
for 5 years, was President of the Django Software Foundation. He's also
the founder of the BeeWare project, developing GUI tools to support the
development of Python software. When he's not contributing to open
source, he's the CTO of TradesCloud, a company providing integrated job
management software for tradespeople.

“Python has long been available on ‘all the platforms’, but it hasn't
kept up with the massive increase in mobile devices,” said Richard
Jones, conference chair. “Russell has has been an exemplary community
leader and his open source projects are doing the important work of
addressing that lack of coverage.”
