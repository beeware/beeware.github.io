description:

The world is filled with programming languages. There are
object-oriented languages; there are functional languages; there are
logical languages… the list goes on. Every language has strengths and
weaknesses. Any moderately popular language will be popular because
there is some problem domain where it’s strengths provide a significant
advantage. And for most of the history of computing, you were largely
free to choose the programming language that was a good match for your
specific problems.

Then came the web - an environment where only JavaScript was available.
20 years ago, when JavaScript was only being used to do minor animation
effects, that wasn’t really a problem. However, the demands of modern
web design require moving more and more business logic into the browser.

What do you do if your business logic isn’t a good match for
JavaScript’s capabilities, or if you have a significant body of existing
business logic that is written in Python, not Javascript? Do you have to
re-implement all your existing logic? Or are there ways to get your
non-Javascript code running in the browser?

In this talk, you’ll learn about a range of techniques that can be used
to execute Python code in the browser, including some options that are
starting to emerge from the browser standardization process.
