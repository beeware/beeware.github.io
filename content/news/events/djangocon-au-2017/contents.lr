description:

DjangoCon AU is annual gathering of Django developers in Australia, celebrating it's 5th year in 2017. It is held as a one day specialist event at the start of PyCon AU.

DjangoCon AU content will be Django specific, but there will also be useful Django-related content in the main PyCon program.

There will also be Django developers at the sprints held after PyCon.
