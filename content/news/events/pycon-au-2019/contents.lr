description:

Web Assembly, or WASM, is perhaps the biggest change to come to the Web
since the introduction of JavaScript. It has the potential to radically
alter what we think of as “the Web”, and how we program for the Web as a
platform. It’s especially interesting for those using Python web
frameworks, because it provides a path for executing server-side web
application logic as a client-side capability in the browser.

In this talk, you’ll get a gentle introduction to WASM, covering both
the history and theory, and the practical approaches you’ll need as an
author of WASM code. You’ll learn about the tools that exist to help you
write WASM code, and how to use those tools as part of your Python web
projects today. You’ll also learn what the future may hold for Python on
the web.
