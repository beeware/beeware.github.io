Despite many differences, the popular platforms that have emerged over
the last 10 years have one thing in common: they all promote programming
language monocultures. The platform manufacturers provide a single
language, and strongly encourage all developers to use that one language
for all projects - Javascript for browsers; Objective C (or Swift) for
iOS; and Java for Android.

The open source world is populated with a wide range of programming
languages. Object oriented and Functional, scripting and compiled,
mainstream and experimental - there is an almost endless supply of
options, each with their own advantages and disadvantages, strengths and
weaknesses. However, they've largely remained tied to traditional server
environments.

Is it possible to break the language monoculture, and port existing open
source languages to these new hardware platforms platforms? Thankfully,
the answer is yes. The BeeWare project has successfully ported Python to
browsers, phones, tablets, set top boxes and watches. Although the
specific implementations of the BeeWare project are Python specific, the
general approaches taken could be applied to any language.

In this presentation, you'll be introduced to the task of porting
languages to a new platform, and the various approaches that can be
used, depending on the restrictions that a particular platform may
impose.
