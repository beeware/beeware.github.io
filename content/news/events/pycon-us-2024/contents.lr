description:

The modern mobile phone is an incredibly powerful computing device.
However, mobile platforms have historically excluded the Python data
science community, requiring specialist platform-specific skills, or
making the use of Python data science tools exceedingly difficult.

This isn't true any more. In this talk, you'll learn how to build and
run an app on your phone that uses the Python data analysis and
visualization tools you're already familiar with, like NumPy and
Matplotlib. No special mobile development skills are required; only a
basic familiarity with Python.
