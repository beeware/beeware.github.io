description:

The web is an amazing platform for building and deploying code so that
users can access functionality. As Django developers, you know how to
use Python to build views and APIs that integrate with a database, and
how to develop frontend HTML, CSS and Javascript. But sometimes, you
need a little bit more than a website can provide. You need an app.

Apps provide a different experience for end users, and access to more of
your device’s native capabilities. If you were to look into the Apple’s
developer resources for iOS, or Google’s developer resources for
Android, you might come to the conclusion that, as Python web
developers, you’re locked out of these app ecosystems. The good news:
you’re not.

In this talk, you’ll learn multiple techniques for leveraging your
existing Python skills and Django codebase to develop an app you can
distribute to your end-users. You’ll also learn the advantages,
disadvantages and limits of these approaches - and what to do when you
hit those limits.
