description:

Have you ever wanted to write a GUI application you can run on your
laptop? What about an app that you can run on your phone? Historically,
these have been difficult to achieve with Python, and impossible to
achieve without learning a different API for each platform. But no more.

BeeWare is a collection of tools and libraries that allows you to build
cross-platform native GUI applications in pure Python, targeting
desktop, mobile and web platforms. In this tutorial, you'll be
introduced to the BeeWare suite of tools and libraries, and use those
tools to develop, from scratch, a simple GUI application. You'll then
deploy that application as a standalone desktop application, a mobile
phone application, and a single page webapp - without making any changes
to the application's codebase.
