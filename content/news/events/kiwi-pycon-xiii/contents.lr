description:

The first version of the Python programming language was released 33
years ago. The computing world that existed then is radically different
to the world that exists today - and as a result, the language,
community and users of Python have changed as well.

In this keynote, Dr Keith-Magee will reflect on how Python, and
computing as a whole, has changed over the years. He will also look at
what hasnâ€™t changed - and make some predictions about what the future
may hold for Python.
