description:

Everyone knows you can write iOS, OS X, tvOS and watchOS apps using
Objective C and Swift, Apple's officially blessed technologies. But what
if you want to use a different language? What if you've got an existing
codebase in a different language, or want to us a language that is more
approchable to people without a background in programming?

This talk shows how Python can be used as a viable development language
for Apple platforms. It explores the mechanics of how Python can
interact with native Apple APIs, and demonstrates some related tools
that make the process of creating an iOS, OS X, tvOS or watchOS project
in Python relatively easy.
