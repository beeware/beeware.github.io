Amber Brown pretends to be an owl on the internet.
When she's not releasing or working on Twisted, she works on software for various commercial and non-profit companies.
She's so good at talking endlessly about Twisted that Russell even once invited her to keynote on it.

Also, she likes people tweeting pictures of owls at her.
