## All Contributions Welcome

It's not just about code. A successful software project requires
documentation, design skills, feedback and bug reports. The BeeWare
community acknowledges that all contributions are important - not just
the ones that come as a pull request on GitHub.

## Sprints

Are you joining the BeeWare project at a **sprint**? A sprint is an
unstructured gathering where we work on BeeWare and related projects,
and introduce new contributors to the contribution process. If this is
your first time sprinting, BeeWare has a [guide for getting started with
BeeWare sprints](/contributing/sprint-guide/).
