title: GitHub Notifications 101
---
summary: So you're now using GitHub, and it's notifying you. What now?
---
body:

Once you start contributing to BeeWare, GitHub is going to start notifying you
about things.

This is a good thing! But it can get overwhelming; so, here are some tips to
help you battle the deluge.

- If you prefer email notifications only, disable the "Web" notifications.

- If you prefer not to get email notifications, disable the "Email"
  notifications.

If you do prefer email notifications, there are a bunch of ways you can handle
things.

Repo settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each repo has a number of notification settings:

- Watching - you get notifications for __everything__. Any issue, any Pull
  Request, any comment. This is helpful if you really really super duper care
  about a repo

- Not Watching - you will only get notifications if you're mentioned, or when
  you're participating (say, on your own Pull Request)

- Ignoring - never ever ever be notified.

You can check what repos you're watching across all of GitHub from the
`watching page <https://github.com/watching>`_.


Email filters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GitHub emails are rich in information that can help you filter out what you
care about and what you don't.

Emails will have the subject line of repo in question

- For example, ``[beeware/batavia] Add a new function`` would be a notification
  from the repo Batavia

If you're mentioned by name:

- the email will be cc'd to ``mention@noreply.github.com``

- the email will include the phrase ``You are receiving this because you were
  mentioned.``

If you're only subscribed to a repo:

- the email will be cc'd to ``subscribed@noreply.github.com``

Ssshhhhhh
~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to mute a specific thread, you can click the 'Unsubscribe' button
on any issue or pull request.

If you get email, you can click on the 'Mute this thread'.
