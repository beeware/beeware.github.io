body:

:code:`git` is a `Version Control System 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control>`_, which lets us save, store
and share changes to code over time.

`GitHub <https://github.com>`_ is just :code:`git` under the hood, but includes 
a lot of helpful things, like a web interface, and nice Pull Requests and Issue 
Tracking systems.
