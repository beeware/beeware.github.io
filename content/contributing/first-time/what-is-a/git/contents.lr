body:

:code:`git` is a `Version Control System <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control>`_, which lets us save, store and share changes to code over time.

 `GitHub <https://github.com>`_ is just :code:`git` under the hood, but includes a lot of helpful things, like a web interface, and nice Pull Requests and Issue Tracking systems.
