body:

`git` is a [Version Control
System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control), which lets us
save, store and share changes to code over time.

[GitHub](https://github.com) is just `git` under the hood, but includes
a lot of helpful things, like a web interface, and nice Pull Requests
and Issue Tracking systems.
