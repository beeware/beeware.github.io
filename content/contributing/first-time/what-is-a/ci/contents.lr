summary: What is CI, or Continuous Integration
---
body:

Continuous integration, or CI, is a way that we can test every code change that is made
to a project. These systems automatically listen for new pull requests and other events,
and automatically run test suites, and other automatic processes.

We use GitHub's CI system: `Actions <https://github.com/features/actions>`_. Normally
the *build status* of a project is displayed as an image on the project's README file.
Green means the tests have been successful, and red means they have not. Clicking the
image will show you the results of these tests.

Unsure which CI environment is being used?
-------------------------------------------

Check for the configuration file. GitHub CI workflows are configured in the
``.github/workflows`` directory.
