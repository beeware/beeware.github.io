title: What is a DCO?
---
body:


The BeeWare project uses a mechanism known as a `Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) </contributing/how/dco/>`__ to manage this process. The DCO is a legally binding statement that asserts that you are the creator of your contribution, and that you wish to allow BeeWare to use your work.

Acknowledgement of this permission is done using a sign-off process in Git. The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the explanation for the patch. The text of the DCO is fairly simple (from `developercertificate.org <https://developercertificate.org>`__)::

    Developer Certificate of Origin
    Version 1.1

    Copyright (C) 2004, 2006 The Linux Foundation and its contributors.
    660 York Street, Suite 102,
    San Francisco, CA 94110 USA

    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
    license document, but changing it is not allowed.

    Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

    By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

    (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
        have the right to submit it under the open source license
        indicated in the file; or

    (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
        of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
        license and I have the right under that license to submit that
        work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
        by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
        permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
        in the file; or

    (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
        person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
        it.

    (d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
        are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
        personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
        maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
        this project or the open source license(s) involved.

If you are willing to agree to these terms, you just add a line to every git commit message::

    Signed-off-by: Joe Smith <joe.smith@email.com>

If you set your ``user.name`` and ``user.email`` as part of your git configuration, you can sign your commit automatically with ``git commit -s``.

Unfortunately, you have to use your real name (i.e., pseudonyms or anonymous contributions cannot be made). This is because the DCO is a legally binding document, granting the BeeWare project to use your work.
