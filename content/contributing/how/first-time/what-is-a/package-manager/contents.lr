title: Package Managers
---
body:

Installing software on your computer can be interesting. Sometimes you have to
download a file and then install it yourself, or copy files to specific places
on your computer. 

However, `package managers` help make this process easier by allowing for the
automation of installation of software. 

There are different levels of package managers: for the operating system level,
as well as one specifically for Python packages. 


MacOSX
---------------

`Homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`_ is the standard for installing software on your
Mac. This is the system that's used if you run a :code:`brew install` command. 

Linux
------------

Depending on what family of operating system you run, you'll use
:code:`apt-get` (for Debian and Ubuntu) or :code:`yum` (for Red Hat and CentOS)

Python
------------

:code:`pip` is the way you can install Python software. Running :code:`pip
install` uses the `Python Packaging Index <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_,
also known as `PyPI` or "The Cheese Shop", it's a central repository for Python
code. Many BeeWare projects can be installed using `pip`. 

Why is it called "The Cheese Shop"? It's a `Monty Python
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheese_Shop_sketch>`_ reference :)
